If you are really fat, go by LBM instead of overall weight. And like the other person said. Cut out carbs. The more the better. If you can get below 30g per day of carbohydrates while training hard, you will drop about 1%BF a week. Works. Have done it many times. Just takes discipline.

Depending on\nyour  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If\nyou  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey\ncakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your\ndiet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to\ncalculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans.\n Gym Routine for Toning Up & Weight Loss\n\nWorking  out at the gym can improve your fitness level, develop muscle\ntone and help you lose weight if follow a plan. Outline your course of\naction  to  include  the five components of a balanced fitness routine\nand your time will be well spent.\n\nThe Five Components\nThe  five  components  to  a  balanced  routine include cardiovascular\nendurance,  strength  training,  flexibility,  core-strengthening  and\nbalance.  You  do  not need to incorporate all five elements into your\ntraining  every  time you workout, but you will want to make sure they\nhave  been  included  during  the  course  of several days. You should\ninclude  cardiovascular  workouts  three  to  five  times per week and\nstrength training twice a week, that is a good schedule to start with.\n\nMonday, Wednesday, Friday: Cardio\nOn  these  three  days,  you will want to use a cardio machine at your\ngym.  A good choice for beginner through advanced-level fitness is the\nelliptical   machine.   Other   options   are  the  stationary  bikes,\nstair-steppers  and  treadmills. Your cardiovascular workout will last\nfor  20  minutes.  Start  out going at about 50 percent of the maximum\nexertion  you  are capable of -- or level five out of 10. Stay at this\nmoderate  level  for  two  minutes,  then  increase either your speed,\nresistance  or  incline to make your exertion more difficult, or level\nsix  for  one minute. Continue increasing your level of difficulty for\none  minute intervals until you reach 90 percent of your maximum, then\nreturn  back  to  level  six for one minute. When you are on your last\ninterval  cycle,  or  when you hit 19 minutes, give 100 percent effort\nfor  one  minute.  Then  take  it  down  to a level four for your last\nminute. You will want to stay at this lower exertion level long enough\nto  return  to  as  close  to your normal breathing as possible before\nending your cardio workout.\n \nMonday, Wednesday, Friday: Resistance\nYou  want  to make sure to include all of you major muscle groups over\nthe course of the week if you do not include them all daily. The major\ngroups   are   back,  chest,  legs,  abdominal,  biceps,  triceps  and\nshoulders.  Remember  to work opposing muscle groups such as chest and\nback.  If  there  is a chance you might miss a day, try to include all\nthe  major groups each time you workout. Also, alternate between using\nfree-weights and machines for even greater variety and faster results.\nDo  three sets of weight-bearing exercises per muscle group. The first\nset  should  be  heavy, but comfortable. For you that might be a bicep\ncurl  that weighs 10 lbs.; do 12 repetitions. The second set should be\nheavier  than  the  first so try 12 lbs.; do 10 repetitions. The third\nset  should  be your heaviest and it should be difficult to finish; do\neight reps.\n \nTuesday and Thursday\nSome  trainers  will  tell  you  that interval training burns the most\ncalories  and  others  will  tell you hard and fast cardio is the best\ntraining to lose weight. Do both and you wont have to worry. Pick your\nmachine;  you  will  want  to  work  out  at  an exertion level around\n75-percent of your maximum ability for a solid 40 to 45 minutes with a\nfive  minute cool down at about a level five out of 10. These are good\ndays  to  do  abdominal  exercises  if  you  did not have time on your\ninterval days. Use a stability ball to do 25 crunches, four times, for\ninstance. Spend at least 10 minutes after your workout stretching.\n \nSaturday and Sunday\nTake  Saturday  to  enjoy an activity with your family or to have fun.\nMake it something where you will get your heart-rate up, but you might\nnot  consider  it  a  workout. Consider roller-skating, dog-walking or\nbicycling. And on Sunday, let your body rest. Your body needs a day to\nrecuperate  so  that  you can continue your fast-track towards meeting\nyour fitness goals.",

But don't go overboard with saving it up too, just do it when your body wants you to. Wet dreams can happen randomly, not necessarily due to abstinence. For example they happen more in teenage years but lot less later one in mature men. All depends on your level or arousal and libido. It is wrong to say that the body cannot store beyond a particular amount, the truth is that the excess unutilized fluids are broken down and reabsorbed by the body. \n\nSemen will be replenished in 24-48 hours, it is constantly produced in healthy males.",

Expand and work on it till you can actually do something with it. Maybe you can compete in game tournaments. Also, make a YouTube account. Make a couple videos!

Their lives will be in misery, but you don't care about that, you only care about yourself, not those around you that will be affected by your death. There are people who were homeless and now are millionaires so you really don't know what your life will be like. Things change a lot, you just don't see it now. When I was your age, I had no friends and everyone bullied me and laughed at me at school. My life was awful. But things got better and changed in ways that I couldn't have predicted. I got a job and a girlfriend. Killing yourself is the easy way out, there are many others with far worse problems than you do, and yet they still live on, making the best of a bad situation. My cousin didn't live to be 18, he got cancer at 7 and died at 11 after 4 years in the hospital. He would loved to be alive and 18 like you, you are so lucky to make it to that age.

If things are bad, things can only get better. Right? You are a special person. People love you much more than you think. \n\nSeek help from people & G-d, solve problems, be patient & you will overcome them & be a better person for it. Your life will improve and pain will subside and you will live a more meaningful existence. \"This will also pass.\" \n\nI am sorry about your situation. We can overcome any problem. You can too. I believe you can! Certain things can make life easier:\n\n1. Recognize the Good in Life \n\nMake a list of all the good that you have in life. Know that G-d is providing you with everything, Like: \nYour life, your family, your car, your house, your food, your air, your clothes, your water, your functioning body, your education, your money, your world, your pets, your computer, your electricity, your senses, your brain, your ability to think, etc. \n\nDon't be lead just by the heart. Use your mind to direct your life & let your heart follow. See: \n\nSet Yourself Free \u2013 Breaking Out of a Negative Mindset & Anxiety \nhttp://jerusalemlife.com/?p=2284 \n\n2. Recognize the good in You \n\nRealize your importance. If you saw a person drowning, G-d Forbid, would you probably would try to save them. This shows you are a caring person. Seek help from others instead of hurting yourself. Aren't you just as important than a drowning person? \n\nTake a paper & write all your good qualities & characteristics. Hang it your wall to appreciate yourself daily. \n\nIf you want a list of good qualities that you can just circle: \nAppreciating Your Own Greatness \u2013 Feeling Good About Yourself \nhttp://jerusalemlife.com/?p=2926 \n\nAt the Jerusalem Life site you can order the You are special card to remind you of how special you are. \nhttp://jerusalemlife.com/?wpsc-product=y... \n\n3. People Love You. Talk it with Others \n\nPlease don't hurt yourself. Be patient & things will get better. Speak with friends or family, a social worker, a trusted psychologist and/or an orthodox rabbi about your concerns & they will help soothe your concerns. People want to help. Have the courage to reach out. Please reach out for your own good. Make friends with good people. Choose friends & family that bring you up not down. \n\n4. Solve Your Problems Slowly & Patiently \n\nWrite down : What is the problem? What are the causes? What are possible solutions? Implement these solutions. Be patient & recognize even small improvements. Life doesn't usually change overnight, but things get better & you start seeing light in life little by little. \n\n5. G-d Loves You - Reach out to G-d & He will help you \n\nJews believe & know that G-d is Good. Sometimes problems arise to wake you up to become closer to Hash-m / G-d. You have a Father in Heaven & He wants you to seek Him. When make an effort to solve your problems and try to become closer to Him problems many times are solved. G-d appreciates when you reach out to Him. \n\nG-d loves the people he created. You are a person that G-d created. Meaning G-d loves you. Developing a relationship with Him opens up a new dimension in your life. He has the power to do everything to make your life better. You Just have to pray to Him. \n\nG-d created the Universe. He is omniscient & omnipotent. Jews believe that G-d has no physical or spiritual shape or form. Abraham taught anything that has a weakness or limitation cannot be G-d. He taught it is impossible for G-d to be an object, star, animal, plant or person. \n\nYou can always start over. Here is an article on Starting Over \u2013 Wiping the Slate Clean in Judaism \nhttp://jerusalemlife.com/?p=1357 \n\nPray to the G-d of the Universe - that gave the Jews the Torah - the God of Abraham, Isaac & Jacob. I heard a story of a woman that went to see my friend - a Doctor. She was proud to say she was following the Seven Noahide laws. He asked her why? She said was not answered when she prayed to other \"gods\". When she prayed to the G-d of the Jews, she was answered. \n\n6. Seek Answers to Your Questions \n\nYou can also search or contact the Jewish sites about your life questions or for help like: \nhttp://aish.com \nhttp://jerusalemlife.com \n\n7. Do Good, Be Good & Feel Good \n\nWhen you do kindness to others you feel better about yourself. \n\nFor Jews I would recommend joining an Orthodox Synagogue to be part of the community. There one can Volunteer for Bikur Holim - Visiting the Sick, or Participate or help Organize Torah Lectures, or Teach others Hebrew or about Judaism. Opportunities abound. Be part of the Community. \n\nFor Gentiles I would suggest learning about the & Noahide laws & joining a Noahide community. \n\nFor Both I would suggest doing something productive daily like working at a Job & focus on helping people. \n\nFollow the 7 Noahide Commandments for all humanity according to the Torah. They are called such because they were given to Noah - by G-d to assure the peace & proper functioning of the world. Gentiles don't have to convert to Judaism to receive a place in heaven: they just have to follow the 7 Noahide laws. A gentile / non-Jew that follows them because of the Torah is considered a \"Righteous Gentile.\" The Seven Noahide Laws are seven major categories \u2013 that with their details consist of 30 laws. \n\n1) Respecting G-d \u2013 Not to blaspheme. \n2) Being Faithful to G-d \u2013 Not to Commit Idolatry. \n3) Respecting Human Life \u2013 Not to Kill. \n4) Respecting One\u2019s Fellow\u2019s Property \u2013 Not to Steal. \n5) Respecting the Integrity of the Family \u2013 Not to commit forbidden relations \u2013 which includes prohibitions of adultery, incest, bestiality & homosexuality. \n6) Respect of Life \u2013 Not to eat a limb taken from a living animal. \n7) Law & Order \u2013 Establishing courts of law to enforce these laws. \n\nThe Torah is the law that G-d gave to the Jews in front of millions of witnesses, It was the only time in history that he gave a law to an entire nation. G-d never did & never does change his \"mind.\" \n\nhttp://www.aish.com/jl/jnj/nj/ \nhttp://noahidenations.com \nhttp://asknoah.org \n\nRemember also G-d forgives when a person sincerely repents. Even if a person did bad in their life they can Start Over. \n\n8. Suffering Passes & is for a Purpose \n\nA Wise Man said to a person who had ups & downs in life \"This will also pass.\" When in pain remember \"This will also pass.\" Print it out in big letters & keep it on a wall to remind you. \n\nA person gets used to tough times or learns to cope, or learns to appreciate it or it passes altogether. King David used to appreciate difficulty, because he in it he would feel a closeness to G-d. \n\nButterflies are beautiful. They enter a cocoon to emerge as a beautiful creature. At times suffering helps a person to introspect about how to improve & they emerge as a beautiful person. \n\nSuffering helps us gain a clearer perspective. I used to think life's goal was to \"Get rich, Be Popular & Make waves.\" After my pains, I realized G-d wants us to be a Good person. To use our talents to help others. To Bring out our best & curb our desires that bring us sometimes off the road of happiness. \n\nTry to use the suffering to become closer to G-d & to become a better person. Your suffering is for a purpose. It is not in vain. I found it out from experience. We only see life in a limited perspective - G-d sees it from the beginning of time till the end of time. Your difficulties will make you stronger & allow you to become a greater success - because you went through difficulty & overcame it. \n\nBecause life is difficult it doesn't mean that it is bad. A person suffers to get an education but in the end they reap fruits. Suffering opens new doors that one would have not considered before. I experienced suffering & it allowed me to become closer to G-d & spirituality. \n\n9 Seek to Satisfy Your Soul - Spiritual Renewal through Torah \n\nA person is really a soul not a body. Spirituality is feeling a closeness to G-d. The soul at times feels sad sue to a lack of spirituality. It may feel it is not performing it's purpose. You have a purpose in the world & you achieve it by following & learning the commandments of the Torah. \n\nSome pleasures make the soul happy & pleasures that make the soul sad. Do the pleasures that make the soul happy, like the 7 commandments mentioned above. Help people. Do Kindness. Help your family. Get a Job. Do projects that will help others. You can ask an orthodox Rabbi if you want to know of good projects. \n\nIf You are Jewish Learn Torah & speak with an orthodox Rabbi to learn more & call to Hash-m & he will help you. If you are not, learn the 7 Noahide laws speak with an orthodox Rabbi to guide you & call to Hash-m & he will help. Try to do simple Mitzvot - Like saying the Food blessings, or saying Shema in the Morning and Night. Listen to some Jewish Music. \n\nWhen suffering I used to go to the Public library & read Jewish short story books from Orthodox Jewish sources to soothe me. I would also go to Jewish bookstores. Reading the stories helped me to cope & see life in different perspective & change myself for the good. Some good sources to purchase books are Artscroll & Feldheim Publishers. \n\nIf you are Jewish I would suggest you learn the Pirkei Avot / Ethics of the Fathers. If you are not Jewish, I would suggest you read the Path of the Righteous Gentile: \nhttp://amazon.com/The-Path-Righteous-Gentile-Introduction/dp/087306433X/\nBoth works teach how to live life with more meaning. \n\n10. Please make an Effort to Care for Yourself Because G-d Cares about You \n\nYou are one of G-d's creations & He loves his creations. G-d wants you to live and enjoy life. People do care about you. I am one of them. Hope this helps. & I hope everything works out for the best for you. You have a friend. \n\nAll the best. \nYour Friend.",

My situation is as followed: I have been depressed for about 3 years now but no one ever knew. I have my ways of hiding it I guess. It never even got in the way school-wise (grades and such) until this year. I quit college a few weeks ago because of it. I've always ran away from it using animes, cartoons, games and marijuana (I'm not a pothead though). I comfortably could flee to my own perfect fantasy world. Right now my parents are very disappointed and shocked that I never told them about it, which I did about two weeks ago. The fights with my parents are getting worse, especially with my mom. And they don't know what to do with me anymore. And frankly I don't either. I don't see a future, and I've never seen one. I was just always able to run away from myself and the world. I don't have a job, education, any special skills or talents and no confidence. I don't see much reason to choose to live this life. Should I just accept that this world will not make me happy/that I'm too weak for this world, and kill myself?",

                "answer_text": "The idea of controlling your anger is beautifully expressed by the Bible psalmist David. He said: \u201cLet anger alone and leave rage; do not show yourself heated up only to do evil.\u201d (Psalm 37:8) The way to avoid saying or doing something that you may later regret is to keep from getting \u201cheated up\u201d in the first place. Of course, that is much easier said than done. But it can be done! Let\u2019s consider three ways that you can get your anger under control.\n\n\u201cLet Anger Alone\u201d.\nTo reduce anger, slow down and relax. Try to avoid saying the first thing that comes to mind. If you feel yourself getting overly excited and feel you are in danger of losing control of your emotions, apply the Bible\u2019s counsel: \u201cThe beginning of contention is as one letting out waters; so before the quarrel has burst forth, take your leave.\u201d\u2014Proverbs 17:14.\n\n\u201cLearn to Relax.\nA calm heart is the life of the fleshly organism.\u201d (Proverbs 14:30) Applying this basic Bible truth can improve one\u2019s emotional, physical, and spiritual health. Start by learning simple relaxation methods, which help to reduce feelings of anger. The following techniques p. 9have proved to be effective in combating stress-related anger:\n ● Breathing deeply, which is one of the best\u2014and fastest\u2014ways to reduce the intensity of your anger.\n ● While breathing deeply, repeating a word or phrase that is calming to you, such as \u201crelax,\u201d \u201clet it go,\u201d or \u201ctake it easy.\u201d\n ● Immersing yourself in something you enjoy\u2014perhaps reading, listening to music, gardening, or some other type of activity you find relaxing.\n● Getting regular exercise and eating a healthful diet.\n\nAdjust Your Expectations. \nYou may not be able completely to avoid the people or the things that act as anger triggers, but you can learn to control your reactions to them. This involves changing the way you think.As imperfect humans, we all get angry from time to time. But how we express our anger is a matter of choice. The apostle Paul cautioned fellow Christians: \u201cBe wrathful, and yet do not sin; let the sun not set with you in a provoked state.\u201d (Ephesians 4:26) Yes, by controlling our anger, we can express our feelings in a positive way, a way that works for the benefit of everyone involved.",

My point is to be mindful of your symptoms, any blood in the urine, fever, tiredness, side pain, or pain when you pee are symptoms of a UTI . An STD is not as urgent as a UTI but you will need to see a lady doctor ASAP. Dont mean to embarrass you but were you masturbating prior to your symptoms? That can cause a UTI. In the mean drink one glass of water every 20 minutes to flush out bacteria. Best of luck to you hun! PS: your dad loves you so maybe asking him for help isn't a bad thing.",

It seems best for me when I was a teenager to masturbate 2-to-3 times a week and only once in the day that I masturbated. It does not hurt,epecially if you use some lubricant like petroluem jelly brand name vaseline or you can use olive oil. But do not use soap in the shower as you will end up up with a very sore & red skinned penis. Hand creams are  also good to use. Anything that is good for the skin. The health benefits usually come later in lfe as lubrication of the Prostrate gland. Which also helps to ward off Prostrate Cancer. The only thing you want to remember is to masturbate when you are alone. I usually did it early in the morning before the parents got up.

And how true this is of masturbation\n\nBecause of the changes taking place within his or her body, a youth can become sexually excited even when he or she is not necessarily thinking about sex\n. Among boys, for instance, the tensions produced by various worries, fears, or frustrations can affect their sensitive nervous systems and cause sexual arousal.\n A buildup of semen may in turn produce a nocturnal emission (wet dream), usually accompanied by an erotic dream, or cause a boy to awaken sexually excited\n. Similarly, some young girls may find themselves stimulated accidentally. And a young woman may have a heightened sexual desire just before or after her menstrual period.\n\nSo, often it is what one reads, watches, or listens to for entertainment, talks about, or meditates on, that makes it hard to avoid masturbation. Therefore, being careful about what you take into your mind is essential to break this habit.\n\nFor some people masturbation may become a habit to which they turn for solace whenever they are rebuffed or feel apprehensive about something. Others, however, may withdraw in this way only occasionally, when they are under the most acute emotional stress.\u201d\n\nA high proportion of masturbatory experiences are motivated less by erotic needs than by general anxiety, tension, and boredom for which it becomes a sought-for tranquilizer\n\n.\u201d So when one is upset, depressed, lonely, or under much stress this habit becomes a convenient \u201ctranquilizer\u201d to blot out one\u2019s troubles. (Compare Proverbs 31:6, 7.) \n\nTherefore, to avoid masturbation, you must recognize this as an immature way to deal with problems and be willing to \n\nThe urge to resort to masturbation for sheer pleasure when things are not going well in one\u2019s life can easily cause one to become a \u2018senseless slave to various desires and pleasures.\u2019 (Titus 3:3)\n\n Yet, the apostle Paul states: \u201cI will not let myself be brought under authority by anything.\u201d (1 Corinthians 6:12) He was not going to let his desires become like a harsh master.\n\n On the contrary, Paul wrote: \u201cI pummel my body [fleshly desires] and lead it as a slave.\u201d (1 Corinthians 9:27) He got tough with himself! A similar effort will enable anyone to break free from masturbation\u2014regardless of how hard that is to do.\n\n I hope this helps\n. ",

There is no pill, ointment or bandaid that can take away an emotional pain and if the person is not skilled enough with how to cope with strong negative emotions they turn to a pain that is more familiar to them and is easily treatable and it also helps them focus on the physical pain that is more real because the body is injured, \n\nWhat seems to be the case with you is that you are looking for help, but the help you really need is from a professional who has experience and understanding of those who self-harm. Normally when someone suggests therapy it drums up an image of lying on a couch and a Froidian looking person asking his patient to tell them about their childhood and their parents and any emotional trauma they have experienced while very young. That is no longer the case for therapy, and the therapy that is usually reccomended is counselling rather than seeing a psychologist.\n\nWhat has happened to you is you have had an experience that you have not been able to cope with and you have behaved in the only way you know by self-harming. The physical pain supresses the emotional pain but that emotional pain resurfaces all the time because the physical pain only covers the emotional pain, it doesn't heal the emotional pain.\n\nYou are looking for help because you are finding that your coping mechanism is becoming a problem along with your emotional paint.The help you need requires long term commitment which can be agreed upon between you and a cousellor. \n\nSo you don't worry about what happens during a couselling ssession I will let you know what happens in a couselling session.\n\nWhen the client meets the counsellor they draw up a mutaul contract. The cousellor will tell you all that you tell them is confidential but the only thing that cannot be kept confidential is if you intend to commit a criminal act that would seriously harm yourself or somebody else (self-harming is not considered a criminal act unless you are determined to take your own life). The counsellor will also set a time for how long the session will last for that first session.\n\nOnce that has been agreed upon the counsellor will let you talk about anything you want to talk about. If you find you can't think of anything to talk about the cousellor might ask how your day was. It becomes a conversation but the client does most of the talking. The counsellor will understand that you might not have revealed the core root of what has caused you to self-harm, it may be that you need time to trust the counsellor to determine if they are genuine or not, if what you tell them is going to be held in the strictest of confidentiality or if they are going to report you to your parents at the first opportunity. Counsellors cannot reveal anything the client said in a counselling session without the clients permission.\n\nWhen you feel comfortable about talking about your self harm the counsellor will support you to find the solutions to your problems.",

I've tried not to but its honestly not easy for me to just quit. I'm kind if addicted to the pain I cause myself it may sound stupid to you but it helps me in a way. The problem tho is I've recently cut too deep to where it needed stitches but didn't get stitches for it and my friend is worried about me. I don't want to worry anyone but it helps me. Any good tips on how to quit or another way to help? Don't say anything about doctors or therapy because I've heard all that before.",

Very important that you give counseling a try. \n\n Tomorrow I want you to get active and exercise. Trust me it can help you so much with your mind and emotion! The key is to not give up and feel discourage. Is to do it regularly then you will feel different about your mood and behavior. You feel more in control and be more happier with life. \n\n I'm not talking about regular dancing, skateboarding or sport kind of exercise. Yeah those are beneficial to but won't help you as much as old school resistant strength training combine with cardio like running non stop for 20 to 30 minute straight cardio and strength training like doing something that is anerobic. Exercise is more powerful than people think. You'll be thrill to find out the benefits. Give it 4 to 5 days a week of 20 to 30 minute combine with resistant training and cardio each day for 2 weeks I guarantee you will be like a new person. More happier and calmer despite any cirmcumstances. It seems like a joke but do it daily you'll be amazed on how calm and focus and positive you can be! Exercise release the natural pain killer and mood enhancer called endorphin helping with anxiety, depression, anger, you name it. Watch your diet. Stay away from junk, caffeine, alcohol, drugs, and other stimulant. Be very careful with prescription drugs. Eat plenty of fresh fruits. The power of exercising along with healthy diet is an amazing cure for most of our problems but sadly most people take it for granted. So give it a try for 2 months I'll bet you'll be amazed how exercise and healthy diet can help you with your problems significantly.",

Meditate (it sounds corny but it actually does work)\n2. Seek counseling. Most states offer free counseling programs, that include giving free anxiety meds and/or talking to qualified awesome professionals. \n3. Always keep an open circle of trusted friends/family you can talk to. Sometimes being able to vent to unbiased people is the best therapy!!\n4. If your sleep is completely off, take a sleep aid (Tylenol PM for example). Of course you can't take them forever, but they def. offer a quick run start\n5. Do some yoga or exercise. People don't realize how doing the small things can greatly affect the mind in a positive way. \n6. Get to the root of your depression. When did it start? What/who are your triggers? Do the emotional homework & get to the deep rooted problem of your depression/anxiety. The depression itself is the \"symptom\" of the problem, NOT the root cause of the problem. You'd be surprised at how freeing it is when you can at least acknowledge the true source of the problem (the 1st step in getting help) \n7. Go back to doing all the things you stopped doing. Depression fatigues people, makes them go into the shadows & makes them lose interest in things/people they normally would've still been doing. Keep yourself distracted & FORCE yourself to go out & have fun. Don't isolate yourself no matter how much you want to b/c it'll just lead to a false sense of feeling like you're alone. If you used to write, go to karaoke, or go to really fun places or hang out with really fun friends before all the anxiety started, go back & do those things \n8. Go to a support group or do some research on depression. The best feeling in the world is when you realize that not only are you not alone, but there are people out there who face the same demons as you, if not worse! Just having someone you can relate to, especially if they've overcome the same demons you're trying to overcome, is probably the most effective methods to abolish depression (i.e. the advice I'm giving you)\n9. If you're a spiritual or religious person, pray. Ask God to remove the depression, loneliness & anxiety from your spirit & body. \n10. Funny vines & videos are taking over the social media scene. Watching all the funny vines, videos & seeing all the hilarious memes has really helped me in grieving the death of my mother & my bipolar disorder\n11. And keep doing what you're doing! It's great that you're asking for help & for solutions b/c that means that you're more strong & courageous than you think! We've all got demons of all kinds! It's just that some people (you) are more honest about it than others, so kudos! \nGoodluck",

Once you turn YY and they are no longer legally required to take care of you, they could kick you out for not doing what they want you to.

Many women remove unwanted hair on their legs, bikini line and top lip as well as a line of it which can run from the navel to the crotch which is personal choice more influenced by society than anything else. Some people don't remove it more due to feminist context, or because it irritates their skin. Realize however, if you don't remove the hair - especially in your armpits - it can make it more difficult to keep the area clean and prevent B.O. from developing.\n\nIf you don't want to shave, you can always use other hair removal methods like depilatories, waxing, sugaring or electrolysis, but you're best researching them first to work out which method is best for you.\n\nHope this helps.",

I was fortunate enough to have a mother who encouraged me not to shave as hair under the arms, on the legs, and between the legs indicates that you are becoming an adult whether you are male or female. She was also very good at pointing out how most women shave only because of social expectations, peer pressure etc. but ultimately left the decision up to me as she respected the fact that even at YY years old my body was, and is MY body. I decided that she was right and have never removed in any way any of the hair under my arms, between my legs, anal area, \"treasure trail\" on my stomach, and upper legs. I do shave my calves in the summer if I am going to be wearing shorts or a dress which isn't very often AND be in public. My dad was smart enough to stay out of that area of my life but has always backed me up as has obviously my mom. Also like Thea I've been lucky enough to have a wonderful boyfriend for the last 4 years who absolutely loves that I don't shave or trim the majority of my body hair. Yes it is very true also that there are definitely guys out there that prefer women \"au naturel\", maybe not many but they do exist.\n\n Your parents really need to back off, that is totally disrespectful of them irregardless of you living with them or not. If they were complaining about armpit odor or something then it would be understandable if they asked you to bathe more but I'm sure you do. Armpits, hairy or not will smell if you don't bathe regularly and thoroughly and I'm sure you do so they don't have that reason. The only thing I can suggest is to wear full length jeans and tops that don't reveal your armpits.\n\n Also one last thing, anyone, guy or girl, that tells you that not shaving is disgusting, just consider them a narrow minded moron.",

I'm sure you have reasons why you do not want to shave and those reasons and your decision should be respected. There should be more women like you making people question what a woman should and should not do. The answer is based on personal choice. Anyone that tells you you have to or should shave can go mind their own business, and if not shaving is what makes you comfortable that is what is truly sexy. You will find many people who thinks it's gross but trust me you will also find people that don't care and even respect you more for not following the crowd.

What's actually more dangerous is being around children who have been newly vaccinated with live virus vaccines, which include the MMR and certain flu vaccines. The children can shed the virus and infect an individual with a compromised immune system.\n\nEDIT: I'm assuming I got 5 \"thumbs down\" because I didn't immediately attack this woman because she didn't vaccinate her children. While I am a stern proponent of vaccination, I thought it better to answer her question than attack her. I've been a chemotherapy nurse for 10 years. Part of the patient teaching when they begin chemotherapy is to avoid contact with children who have just received live-virus vaccines. And yes, April, these are definitely still used. MMR, varicella, rotovirus, and the nasal flu vaccine are all live-attenuated viruses. Once an individual is vaccinated, there is a small risk of infection to individuals with immune compromise.\n\nAlso, there is NO risk of contacting things like measles, mumps, or whooping cough from someone who DOESN'T have it. While unvaccinated children are at risk of contracting these diseases, they are not automatically carriers just because they haven't had their shots - which is what it sounds like some of you are saying. \n\nPatients undergoing chemotherapy should do their best to avoid situations in which they put themselves at risk. Your home is not one of them. Good hygiene, including hand washing, is a major step in prevention of communicable diseases.",

                "answer_text": "Food that are really good for you are veggies and fruits, (Having a healthy diet...) Citrus fruits such as oranges that contain a lot of Vitamin C, Vitamin C helps increase the production of white blood cells, a key to fighting infections. Red Bell Peppers, are also a good source for Vitamin C, as well as being a rich source of beta carotene's. Broccoli is super-charged with Vitamins A, C, and E, as well as numerous antioxidants. The key to keeping its power intact is to cook it as little as possible, or better yet, not at all. Garlic helps to lower cholesterol and prevent hardening of arteries. Its immune-boosting properties seem to come from a heavy concentration of sulphur-containing compounds, such as allicin. Ginger acts like Vitamin C, and is good for preventing a cold or helping a cold. It packs some heat in the form of gingerol, a relative of capsaicin, which gives chili peppers their distinctive heat. Ginger may also help decrease chronic pain and may possess cholesterol-lowering properties. Spinach is rich in Vitamin C and is packed with numerous antioxidants and beta-carotene. Yogurt is a good source of Vitamin D, studies show someone who is low in Vitamin D is more likely to catch a cold. When selecting yogurt look for ones that have \"live and active cultures\" printed on the label. Almonds (Nuts) are a good source of Vitamin E, which also helps keep a healthy immune system, Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin, meaning it requires the presence of fat to be absorbed properly. Turmeric a bitter spice has been used for years as an anti-inflammatory in treating both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. High concentrations of curcumin, which gives turmeric its distinct color, have been shown to contain strong flu and cold fighting properties. Both green and black teas are packed with flavonoids, a type of antioxidant. Where green tea really shines is in its levels of epigallocatechin gallate, or EGCG, another powerful antioxidant. The fermentation process black tea goes through destroys a lot of the EGCG. Green tea, on the other hand, is steamed and not fermented, preserving that EGCG. If that wasn't enough, it's also a good source of the amino acid L-theanine, which aids in the production of germ-fighting compounds in your T-cells.\n\nBesides eating you should:\nGet vaccinated\nCover coughs and sneezes\nAvoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth\nWash your hands often\nLimit contact with Sick People\nClean your house\nPractice healthy habits: Getting plenty of sleep, eating well, drinking lots of fluids, exercising, and managing stress can go far in keeping your family well this flu season.\n\nHope that helps... and not too long! :)",

So is chamomile but it is also sort of a sedative used best before bedtime. If you get a book on herbal remedies or just google the info you can find a lot of information. GNC has a book by Phylis Balch on nutritional health. Also many table spices are actually medicine. Most have zinc and calcium which help fight colds and flu. I use many spices like thyme, sage, oregano, cayenne, turmeric. You can goggle those also and find a lot of specific info. Some foods and spices are also appetite suppressors so you can cut down on calories by eating them. Personally I use herbal teas and table spices, eat low sugar cereals. Teas are also low calorie beverages that are sweetened with mint and other spices. Buy tea bags. They are cheaper than sweetened bottled drinks too. Stevia is also a natural sweetener. There is also a book called '20 foods that will help you lose weight'. It takes 2 to 3 months for natural remedies to strengthen your immune system so have to be patient and give it some time. Andremember, ask God for wisdom and He will help you too.",

There are 3 people sent me an email saying to me that it worked for them!! This was also been chosen by 10 members to be the best answer because it worked for them too!! Proof, see my best answers!!\n\nGather all materials beforehand -- see \"Things You'll Need\" below. You might want to store them in a waterproof resealable bag, such as Ziploc. I'd recommend wearing either old clothes or a bathrobe over whatever you are wearing. There is a definite possibility this is going to spill. After you have found everything on you checklist, head to a large, flat, waterproof surface. This is probably your bathroom. Having this room be private is highly advised; you can't just say, \"Get out, I'm flattening a pimple,\" can you?\n\nThings You'll Need \n- 3 or more cotton balls \n- Lukewarm tap water \n- Cup to hold the water in \n- Salt\n\nThe Method \n1. Salt the water thoroughly -- much more than you think it needs. \n2. Dip one cotton ball in the salt water. \n3. Wait for 30 - 60 seconds. \n4. Squeeze out excess water out until it is damp, but not dripping. \n5. Place the damp cotton ball over your large, oh-my-goodness-I-cannot-go-to-... zit. If you have several of these grouped together, try to place the cotton ball over them all. \n6. Glance at your watch/clock. Wait exactly three minutes. \n7. Remove the cotton ball after the time is up. The zit seems to be nearly gone, but it is only the top that has dissolved. Your acne is still there. \n8. Take the other two cotton balls and place them on either side of the despised pimple. \n9. Slowly, move them closer together until the tiny bump is flattened. Congrats! You've just conquered that giant of a pimple -- forever! \n10. Apply honey on the infected area & go to sleep!!\n\nTips \n*Don't forget the last 3 steps -- they are crucial. \n*Be sure to follow these steps closely. Dipping a cottonball in fresh water as opposed to salt will not work, for instants. \n* You might want to bring a book -- either waterproof or one that you do not care about being splattered in water. Those three minutes can get boring. \n* This is your best bet for monster zits that simply sneak up on you. For long-term healthy skin, cleansing and toning is also important.\n\nWarnings \n* Please, PLEASE, do not assume this is permission to \"pop\" pimples. Doing so can cause major scarring. Please don't pop them. \n* If you stop after the top is dissolved, I must warn you: it WILL come back! Maybe not in the next five minutes, but during the course of an hour, it will come back!\n\nYou can even try applying original Head & Shoulder Shampoo to clear acne!!! I WORKS like a charm!! Read all about it here including people's comment about it! \nhttp://www.myhomeremedies.com/remedy.cgi?remedyid=1801&page=1\n\nIf you feel new pimples erupting, ice it! Hold an ice cube over the area for about 5-10 minutes. It REALLY works!!!\n\nFor acne scars, \n1. Lemon juice is natural bleach and helps in lightening the scars and blemishes of the skin. \n2. Rosehip seed oil is also another home remedy which reduces acne scars. It is mostly used in the cosmetic products and used for acne scarring, facial scarring, surgical scars, sun damage, premature aging, burn marks etc. This oil should be massaged twice on the acne scars daily. \n3. Application of Aloe Vera gel/juice to the fresh wounds prevents the formation of permanent scars. \n4. One of the home remedy is that ice cubes can be rubbed on the acne scars for ten to fifteen minutes. \n5. Vitamin E is considered best for the healthy glowing skin. Application of vitamin E oil or capsule to the scar will completely vanish the scar in few weeks. \n6. The most effective remedy for the scars is application of honey several times a day. It will give a natural glow to the skin and will remove all scars.\n\nIf you have too many pimples/whiteheads/blackheads/ acne/acne scars/... I recommend you to try Carley's Clear & Smooth!! It's CHEAPER & BETTER than Proactive!! People are raving about this product!! Read their feedbacks/reviews!!",

We believe we've run out of options, and suicide is the only answer left.\n\nMaybe the suicidal thoughts come to mind, you might have mixed feelings about them.  They're frightening and confusing. \n\nFor some people, suicide may be a way of getting back at others, or showing them how much pain you're in.  But after suicide, you won't be there to see that they feel guilty, or finally understand your pain.\n\nSuicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.\n\nFeelings will pass.  Depression feels permanent, but it's transient.  Things will change.  Depression comes and it goes.

Unlike other drugs, you don't go into coma after an overdose of paracetamol. This is very annoying because next morning you will wake up normally and wonder what happened to you!\nAfter 2-3 days, liver starts getting damaged (Hepatic damage) and so does your kidneys (Renal damage).\nSlight signs of jaundice appears (bilirubin starts increasing. The normal bilirubin level is 1 and when it increases beyond 1, it means jaundice is making a hole in you!) and you will face terrible pain in stomach.\n\nBelieve me! This is when you will be taken to hospital and saved! Just in case you manage to stay out of hospital and don't visit a doctor, there are fairly good chances that intra-abdominal bleeding will start and you may face aspiration pneumonia,And it could take up to a week to die.(If left untreated)\n\n(If you really are contemplating suicide please just think about what your doing but theres nothing i can do to stop you but if your are at least do it right but in most cases of overdoses you are just taken to the hospital and are saved but you are left with 2 really ruined livers and in some case life destroying medical problems.BUt i would check out the link i posed in \"Source\".",

Try to find you \"hole\", if you are having dificulties finding your hole, use a little hand mirror, be careful not to drip. You need to relax, or else while you are trying to insert the tampon, it will hurt and be even harder to put in. Put your fingers on the grip, insert the tampon, not strait up. Push it in until you fingers touch your skin. Then push on the little pushy thing until the tampon is out of the inserting thing. It is impossible to lose your tampon in your vagina. If you don't believe me look up a diagram and look at it yourself. But i assure you, it's impossible to lose your tampon in your vagina. When the tampon is in, put your underwear on and tuck the string in your underwear. ( The tampon stays inside of you, but the string is not in your body, it helps you take out the tampon ). You are good to go, change your tampon every 4-8 hours. When you need to take it out, pull on the string. As i say before, relax, being tense will only make things worse. Pull on the string and wrap the tampon in toilet paper. Do not flush thape tampon in the toilet. Sorry that this was really long hope this helps and good luck.",

                "answer_text": "Neither, I prefer menstrual cups. \n\nMenstrual cups are internal like tampons but FAR safer and more hygienic so no risks of TSS, vaginal infections, increased cramps, or dioxin - thus they can be worn for up to 12 hours, with any flow, before your period, overnight, and no need to alternate with pads so a lot more convenient than tampons. Menstrual cups are more comfortable, can reduce flow and cramps, also don't leak like tampons or pads.\n\nI seriously recommend you consider cups instead of tampons, they're far better in general but also when active they're better than tampons as you can't wear tampons when your flow is light, tampons can increase cramps, and tampons leak. Any cup user will tell you, tampons suck by comparison. \n\nIf you do still want to use tampons...\n\nAvoid rayon tampons like Tampax, Playtex, or Kotex - these are made from rayon which is rougher than cotton so causes more damage to vaginal tissues, also is more favourable to bacteria and contains chemicals - these increase risk of TSS, vaginal infections, increased cramps, contain dioxin, and more likely to cause irritation too. Opt for cotton tampons like Cottons, Natracare, or Emerita, you may also be more comfortable with sponge tampons like J&P or soft tampons like Beppy as they're soft and squishy plus are moistened before use with either water or lubrication so not as drying or irritating. \n\nNon-applicator are best - applicators sole purpose is to limit genital contact, not to make insertion easier, and as there's nothing wrong with genital contact there's no reason to use applicators. Non-applicator are easier because they're simpler, have rounder tips, you have more control over depth so you can insert high enough first time, and you have more control over direction as you can more easily feel for resistance. \n\nAlways start with lowest absorbency during heaviest flow; if the tampon leaks within 1-2 hours use higher, but if the tampon isn't saturated with blood after 4-6 hours use lower absorbency or switch back to pads. It helps to use lubrication the first time too, something like KY jelly or a natural oil like coconut oil or olive oil around the vaginal opening and on the tampon - do not ever use Vaseline or baby oil. \n\nMasturbation helps as when aroused your vagina relaxes, lubricates, opens, increase in size, and tents to allow penetration, thus it can help when inserting a little tampon - same goes for if you struggle with removal too. It also helps to explore your genitals, if you haven't already, to get used to inserting things vaginally and learn to purposefully tense/relax vaginal muscles so you can relax them during insertion.\n\nAs long as you use tampons correctly and relax (if you tense vaginal muscles tense, thus causing vaginal walls to clench) they shouldn't hurt, although they can be uncomfortable. As long as you relax they also won't get stuck either - what goes up must come down.",

Personally, I like being able to keep track of my flow, and that's why I usually use a pad, but here are some tips:\n\nStart out by trying the lowest absorbency tampon you can get.  Something like \"lite\" or even \"regular\" will work.  Definitely use plastic applicators - they are much easier to insert.  When you try them, do it on the heaviest day of your period.  Follow the instructions in the box.  When you insert it, remember to point up and toward your back, not straight up.  You shouldn't be able to feel it when it's inserted properly.\n\nYou should only wear the lowest absorbency that you need to control your flow for 4-6 hours.  They way to tell if you need to change is easy - when you go to the bathroom, gently pull on the string.  If it starts to slide out easily, it's time to change.  If it stays put, you can leave it in for a bit longer, but NEVER more than eight hours.  In fact, you might want to switch to a lower absorbency so that it's ready to be changed about every six hours or so, just to be safe and prevent TSS.\n\nDon't flush applicators or used tampons.  The box might say you can, but believe me, it's not a good idea!  Wrap them in toilet paper and put them in the trash or the receptacle in the stall.\n\nFinally, wear a liner or a pad along with tampons for the first few times you use them until you get used to it.  I always wear a liner just in case.",

When skin is opened up, like when you pop a pimple, and then closes back together, you can get abnormal pigmentation, texture, and tone that looks different from the rest of your skin. Sometimes broken blood vessels that remain after an acne lesion fades can result in a mark that appears more red or purple than brown. These are commonly seen in people who are more fair/light skinned.\" The dark spot takeaway? Hands off! Seriously, don't pick, poke, or touch a pimple. You'll regret it. And this is why. \nBut sometimes a particular blemish just has it out for your face and there's no stopping its path to a scar. \"Acne scars occur when normal tissue in the skin is destroyed and replaced with fibrous tissue. You can think of an acne lesion as a wound. When the damage caused by acne is severe, the body can respond by creating too much tissue or too little tissue. The production of too much tissue forms a keloid or a hypertrophic scar, and too little tissue leads to that depression in the skin, or atrophic scar. The deeper and more inflamed the acne lesion, or the more that it is picked or squeezed, the more likely it is to scar.\"",

These will probably help within a couple of hours.\n\nYou can also try doing some light exercises; something as simple as walking a few laps around your house may help. The movement seems to help make the muscles down there work better...don't know why, it just works. This also may not work immediately, it may take a while after you walk for it it to work.\n\nAnother option, if you really feel you need relief right away, is to give yourself an enema or have someone (like your mom) do it for you. I mention this because of how bad you say you feel- an enema will usually give you relief within a few minutes, but it needs to be done carefully...whoever does it should follow the directions on the package very carefully.\n\nFinally, if nothing helps within a few hours and you are still in pain, go to the hospital. It's possible you may have a more serious problem, like an impaction. In this case, there's something in the intestines that's actually blocking them, keeping you from being able to go. This is pretty rare, but it can happen. Even if that's not the problem, they can help you more than you might be able to do at home.\n\nHope this helps.",

An easy way to do this is to go on a diet of ready-made meals like Smart Ones or some other commerical variety.\n\nUp your workout to seven days a week.  Try to do 40 minutes of cardio and 20 minutes of strength training.  (Do alternating strength training so that you're not working the same muscles on back-to-back days, but rather on alternating days.)  Work out hard enough to get breathing hard and sweaty, but not to the point where you're exhausted and dehydrated.  Standard advice before beginning any workout is consult with a doctor first to make sure you're healthy enough to be doing this.\n\nWeigh yourself every morning after using the bathroom.  Record your daily weight.  This is for motivation.\n\nEvery two weeks or so, for ONE MEAL ONLY eat whatever you want.  Don't weigh yourself for the next two days after doing this.\n\nDrink a LOT of water.\n\nIf you stick to this program faithfully, you could lose 5 pounds a week.  This is an unhealthy rate of weight loss to sustain, and if you continue it, you will notice repercussions.  Like for instance, you may start to shed a lot of hair.  After you've lost your 10 pounds, increase your diet to a more healthy 1,400 to 1,600 calories per day and set a weight loss goal of closer to 2 pounds a week, 3 at the most.\n\nGood luck but also be careful.",

Cardio is best for weight loss! So running, swimming, cycling etc. \n\nMake sure that the foods you eat are the right foods also. Lots of vegetables (especially green ones) some fruit, healthy fats, lean protein and wholegrains. Swap white bread/flour/pasta for wholemeal and white rice for brown. Also swap whole milk for skim/trim/soy. Limit fried, deep fried, creamy, fatty and sugary foods. Drink a lot of water and green tea (green tea is believed to help speed up your metabolism).

It made me depressed and my quality of life was just at an all time low. I'm 36 years old and have been struggling with these issues for over a decade. I just don't know what is wrong but I've been able to adapt and get everything back from when I was younger, I'm talking YY-YY when I felt I was in my prime with my sex life. I started having problems after a break up with a girlfriend that I thought was the one but she basically tore my heart out. I was about 24 years old and when I started dating other women, my sex life was doomed. I've had it all from erection problems to all kinds of performance problems. Some were in my head. Anyways, since then I've tried all kinds of things. You know about viagra I'm sure...Who doesn't know about that stuff haha.\n\nAt that point in my life, I tried it but couldn't get it all the time due to the doctors and my age. I knew a buddy who would steal the stuff from his dad for me. I just noticed that it's terrible stuff. I try to avoid pharmeceuticals as it is. I noticed I would get terrible migraines and an occasional blurred vision which truly was scary...Sure the erection was great but the side effects blew... In the meantime years passed and I found the love of my life again. The sex was good, the erections were great. No problems at all. No more viagra was needed for quite some time...Then all of a sudden, well you can geuss. Sex life down the toilet again.\n\nI was in my 30's by this time and just was stuck again. I suffer from depression so all this time I'm thinking I'm going through another low libido spell cause of it. Now I go to the doctors cause I feel ok talking about my problem. I've been on the cialis crap and some other one I can't remember nor do I want to look it up lol. Anyways it's all the same crappy side effects that just make everything terrible.\n\nI did some research and after a while everything started to make sense. I hated pharmaceuticals and a friend told me about the herbal way to get an erection and all these good articles about it. He said chinese men have been using these herbs for centuries to cure there problems in the sack. I figured what the hell...might as well give it a shot if it's not going to give me any side effects. I tried a couple of these out. To my amazement, both of them did what I needed so I kinda just have fun with each one. I'll explain why. I just needed something to get up. This one I found called vigrx plus was the one for this. It's all herbal and after a couple days of taking..you take it daily, I noticed right away my junk just wanted to stand straight up, sex drive was something that was crazy..you really can't handle yourself ..lol jk but you are like a teenager again... Check this stuff out at hughs-reviews.com because I saved money on it at the time there along with this other supplement I got there too...Check for coupons and updates. This one I just wanted to see if it worked cause it was suppose to increase your semen quality and amount. So right there I'm thinking damnn that must give you one hell of an orgasm. This was semenax, and I fiddle with it every once in a while when I want to load my wife up. She's always impressed with the amount and she even says it tastes better!! yippy if you know what I mean. Overall, I'm so glad I took the herbal route of keeping my sex life up to par.\n\nStruggling with it for long really messes with you so I know and feel ya when people talk about it. Good luck and I hope this helps you.",

Cut a hole in the middle of the cap and put the wrench piece in so it fits securely. Get a hollow pen part (the body of a pen with everything taken out) and stick it through the bottle about 1.5 inches from the bottom. Now load the weed into the wrench piece and place the wrench piece on the water bottle and maybe turn it a little so it stays securely on. Put your lips over the pen and suck in while lighting the weed. It's kind of an awkward position but when you start seeing smoke stop lighting and keep sucking in until the bottle fills with smoke. Take the cap off (be careful, the metal wrench piece will be hot), and inhale all the smoke in the bottle from the top. Repeat until the weed ashes and you don't get anymore smoke. You can stash that bottle in a bush near your house or smoking spot to use at later times.",

I would suggest talking to someone. You can be put on safe anti-anxiety medications which can help with the symptoms, and/or you can enter talk therapy where you can learn techniques about ways to better manage the symptoms. \n\nI'm sure you;ve tried a lot, so I'm not going to go into ways you can try to relax (like yoga and mindfulness and whatnot). But this IS treatable. Don't give up, and try to stay healthy. Drinking may put a band-aid on it for a short while, but it wont fix it and it can cause greater problems in the long run.\n\nOne thing I do suggest is not doing too much too soon. Gradually work your way into the world again if you suffer from severe social anxiety. Don't try to jump in the deep end. Just walk around out side by yourself and observe people.. then go to the park and sit on a bench. imagine yourself interacting with people. then try to do so....so on and so forth. Once you can feel relaxed doing one thing, move onto something a little more challenging. it will eventually and gradually get better. Don't try to do it all in one day. Be patient with yourself. It didn't start occuring overnight and it won't go away overnight either. \n\nVisualization helps A LOT. If you can't even think about something without getting anxious, then there is no way you will actually be able to do it without suffering. But once you have thought about it enough and thought about ways to relax and cope, you will feel better, more in control, and better able to handle the situation when the time comes.",

The other, which is not so well known but is gaining acceptance in psychology, is for us to change the way we experience the pain.  I'll give you a link for common depression treatments, because the other way needs some explanation.  \n\nThis link with for the kind of answer I often give for questions from people who are very badly depressed.  It has information from experts on a variety of treatments - self help and office visits.\n\nhttp://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20140211085610AAuz0Gv\n\nIf you want more information, click on my name and Best Answers.\n\nThis is about experiencing pain, which can go along with the treatments I've just referre to.\n\n'The two things to practice are acceptance and mindfulness.  \n\nWhen I say \"acceptance,\" I don't mean pretending that the pain is good. I mean being realistic - above all, not hoping that it will go away overnight or that we'll live happily ever after, like in a fairy tale. It also means not getting carried away about it - me not saying that a bad day was the worst day of my life, as if I had a day-evaluating machine and data collected from my whole life.  If you have a bad day, just say \"I had a bad day\" Period.\n\nMindfulness takes a bit of explaining but it's not hard to understand.  It means awareness - awareness of the here and now and awareness of what's happening in our bodies and minds.\n\nSuppose you were wearing sunglasses day and night for two weeks, and the glasses were so dark that you could hardly see where you were.  One day, you took the glasses off.  Imagine how things would look - all that light, color and details - the grain of wood in a chair or sunlight reflected off points on a glass bottle.  \n\nThe room would seem real, more real than ever before.  It's a intense feeling of the here and now. When we're lost in our thoughts, it's like wearing sunglasses.  We don't really see what's around us.\n\nMost of our troubles are in the past or the future.  If we're right there in the present moment, we feel better.  If we quiet our thoughts, we know the present moment.  Also, we notice as thoughts come and go, including the negative thoughts that hurt - memories and fears of the future that are useless and often false.\n\nLook at your hands and slowly move them as if washing your hands.  Notice the feelings in your fingertips as your gently rub your fingers together.  Look at the palms of your hands.  Notice all the lines going across the palms.  Take two slow, deep breaths. Say, \"Here and now.\"  You're in the present moment, where past and future don't bother you.  Look around and notice all the light and color in the room.  When thoughts come to you, notice them but don't get lost in them.  If a memory comes to you, don't go back to the past and relive the memory.  Let the thoughts come and go.  Notice the negative thoughts and let them go.  Don't fight with any thoughts - just let them go.\n\nBooks that explain this\n\nThe Mindful Way Through Depression (See MBCT.com)\nFull Catastrophe Living by Dr Jon Kabat-Zinn\n\nA 2-minute explanation by Dr Kabat-Zinn of the Univ. of Mass.

She's always exhausted.\n\nI've given her dextrose tablets and told her to take one in every day after lunch time.. but Idk what might help her?

As the prognosis for CHF back then ( treatment has improved ) was that 50% of patients would die in two years and 70% would die in five years, my response to Diabetes was \"That's not too bad, I have worse problems.\".   My choice was either heart transplant or risk other organs to give the heart a chance to recover, diabetes was just a byproduct of it all and there was probably a genetic vulnerability anyways so I was probably going to face diabetes anyways.\n\nI'd imagine type 1 must be very difficult on the young because you are growing up with it but it is something that can be managed.   It's not always easy to deal with and as with any chronic illness, it is always with you and you get tired of it.   I often don't want to take my insulin or heart meds either but really, as long as you stay with it, you can have a normal life.\n\nI have to say, they didn't teach me anything about diabetes at the hospital, they just did the syringe in the orange bit.   I went years before finding out I could use NPH instead of Lantus, NPH is covered by more plans and is dirt cheap by comparison to Lantus.   I also went years before learning it was about the energy I need not just the carbs I eat.   Yeah, diabetes sucks but what sucks more is they don't tell you what you should know about it.",

Right now, I have scar tissue/a membrane on my retinas, probably a result of all the laser surgery I had to do in the 1980s because of diabetic retinopathy.

But most of the time I don't think we're afraid of the dark. I think we're just scared of what we could see in dark (like creepy stuff). But don't worry, I'm just like you. Honestly, I don't think I'll ever grow out of it either, so you're not alone:p",

Then i started to fast walk, then halfway up the stairs i began to sprint the rest to turn on the switch at the top. I went into my room and turned off the lights then went back to the stair light.

Some studies have shown that this process is inhibited by most illicit drugs, such as cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine. However, says Xia Zhang of the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, marijuana's effect on neurogenesis has not been clear.He and his colleagues started investigating this mystery by searching cell surfaces in live, cultured slices of rat hippocampus for receptors that respond to marijuana and a few other similar drugs, called cannabinoids. They reasoned that if marijuana affected neurogenesis in the hippocampus, then cells in that area must have a way to recognize the drug. Sure enough, 95 percent of hippocampus cells responsible for neurogenesis showed evidence of cannabinoid 1 ( CB1 ) receptors, one of two receptors that respond to cannabinoid drugs. http://www.mapinc.org/drugnews/v05/n1624/a06.htmlThe current study focused on a particular formulation of synthetic cannabinoid known as HU210 -- a compound which Zhang described as the most powerful cannabinoid in the world.The authors explored both the short-term and long-term effects of exposure to HU210 in rats.To measure the drug's short-term response, they gave adult rats a single injection of HU210. To study the same drug's effect over the longer term, the researchers gave a separate group of adult rats twice-daily injections of the cannabinoid over a two-week period.Autopsies revealed that by the end of the 10-day HU210 treatment regimen, new neurons had been generated and integrated into the circuitry of the hippocampus region of the rat's brains. This process, known as neurogenesis, was still in evidence a full month after treatment had been initiated.Neurogenesis was not triggered in response to brain cells being killed through cannabinoid exposure, the researchers add. In fact, HU210 injections did not appear to prompt any loss of neurons in the hippocampus. http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=54893Mind you, the study is using a super-concentrated drug form and the verdict is still out on smoking it, but they do suggest THC is the only known drug that actually can reverse the loss of brain cells...",

Let me clear this up for you.It has not been actually proven that marijuana makes you brain regrow cells. Studies done on the subject have POINTED TO THAT POSSIBILITY. But nothing is conclusive as of right now.On the other hand, it wont kill brain cells either. The THC chemical in marijuana travels to your brain when you eat or smoke the plant, and there it connects with special brain cells called Cannabinoid receptors. The THC then lightly coats these cells and in effect sort of tickles them, thereby getting you high. There is no damage caused to the brain at all and its possible that it might help re-grow brain cells, but as I said, nothings been proven yet.Hope that helps.Peace",

                "answer_text": "boiledWhen to Eat and How Often This might sound strange, but you have to eat more often to lose fat and gain muscle. During my transition period, I never ate less than 6 meals a day. \u2022 Try to eat every 2 to 3 hours. \u2022 Do not eat complex carbohydrates after 6:00 p.m. or four to five hours before going to bed. \u2022 Try to eat one gram of protein per pound of lean body mass on lifting days and .8 grams of protein per pound of lean body mass on non-lifting days. \u2022 Never eat more than 70 grams of protein in one meal.Carbohydrates When I think of carbohydrates, I think of energy. Carbohydrates supply our bodies with the energy it needs to make it through a workout. Without an adequate supply of carbohydrates, the body goes into carbohydrate deprivation. This is called a state of ketosis (meaning our body is using protein as energy). This is not a good state to be in for long because it will rob the body of muscle tissue in an effort to create energy. On the other hand, if too many carbohydrates are consumed, they convert into stored fat. The idea is to consume just enough carbohydrates to make it through our workouts with sufficient energy. I have broken down carbohydrates into these three categories: \u2022 Simple carbs: These are sugars, or quick energy. They are absorbed very quickly into the body. Ex. Anything with sugar, also fruit \u2022 Complex carbs: This is where you get long-term energy for the day. These are long chained carbohydrates that brake down slower, giving us energy over a prolonged period of time. Ex. Oatmeal, potatoes, pasta, rice, breads \u2022 Fibrous carbs: These are things like vegetables. I think of them as roughage in order to stay regular. Make sure you include them in you later meals when you can't eat complex carbs. They are also a good source of vitamins. Ex. Leafy vegetables like lettuce.Protein Proteins are the building blocks of our muscles. Without a sufficient amount of protein in our diet, our muscles will not have the raw materials that they need to build up, or even hang on to what is already there. Net protein utilization: Not all protein is created equal. Different foods are absorbed more than others. For example, egg white protein is absorbed at 88%. That means we get about 9 eggs to our muscles. On the other hand, chicken breast are absorbed at 68%, meaning we get about 7 breasts to our muscles. It is imported to eat a wide verity of protein foods though; no one protein source has all the amino acids we need. \u2022 Whey protein (100%): the best source of whey protein is from protein supplements. It is also absorbed very fast by the body, so it is best to take this when your body needs amino acids quickly: like right after a workout or when you first get up in the morning. \u2022 Egg whites (88%) \u2022 Fish (78%) \u2022 Chicken breast (78%) \u2022 Soy protein: My one bit of advice would be to try and stay away from soy protein. It is not absorbed very well by the body. Fats We normally think of fats as being bad. The fact is certain fats are essential to building muscle and carrying out various functions of the body. There are 2 fat types we need to be concerned about: \u2022 Saturated fats: these are the bad fats. Avoid these fats as much as possible. You will find these types of fats mostly in meats \u2022 Unsaturated fats: these are the good fats. They are a good energy source and help us build muscle. You can find from plant oils. Peanuts are also a good source. Water Do not under estimate the importance of water! If you are looking to get lean, water will be your best friend. Drink as much as you can and as often as you can. Also, it is very important to drink lots of water when you're eating large amounts of protein to clean urea from the system. Vitamins & minerals As resistance training athletes, we have a greater need for vitamins & minerals. When we workout and bring blood to our muscles it is important that our blood is full of those essential vitamins & minerals if we want to grow. Supplements Supplements are just that, meaning they are used to supplement your diet, not replace it. Don't ever think of it that way. Hierarchy of supplements:I developed this hierarchy of supplements based on what I thought were the most important and also by price. \u2022 1. Proper diet: Without proper diet you are just wasting money on supplements. Start here! Do not think that supplements are going to do it for you alone. \u2022 2. Multi-vitamin & mineral: It is very important to have all your vitamins & minerals when resistance training. Most of us are lacking in some areas, make it a priority to make this your first supplement. \u2022 3. Protein powder: It is usually very hard to get all the protein you need from real foods. Powders make it much easier. Also, these powders are absorbed fast by the body making them ideal after workouts or before and after sleep. \u2022 4. Creatine: This is great for harder workouts. It also makes you muscles hang on to water, giving them a better environment to grow. \u2022 5. L-glutamine: This is an important amino acid in muscle recovery \u2022 6. Branch chained amino acid: These are great before and after workouts along with L-glutamine because it gives your muscles all the amino acids it needs to repair and grow. \u2022 7. ZMA: This helps you release more growth hormone while you sleep, increasing your size and strength. \u2022 8. Thermogenic: These really help in the fat loss process. They also help you hang on to more muscle while dieting due to the fact you can eat more. \u2022 9. Meal replacement: Although very expensive, meal replacements make it much more convenient to get some of your meals in. Also, you can get in more meals than if you were to eat only real foods.",

You seem to have received more dietary advice than anything else, I noted -AND- although that is very true and good advice, I have quite another avenue for you: I will begin by giving you some specifics as far as your diet is concerned. I noted that one answerer gave advice re: veggies. Very good advice at that. Any diet with brussel sprouts and Carrotsmost certainly, will assist you in your dietary quest for gass-less-ness, we'll call it. Another fact, is that, you should stay away from any fiber, or at least, cut way down on your consumption of the same. There is a relatively new and very popular procedure that people are doing annually as part of their annual physical and it's simply called a: colon cleansing.The only thing that I know about this is what I have read and those that I know personally, that swear by it. I have been told that it is not only effective for gas, but also, makes you feelphysically cleansed and fabulous. Now, as for the non-medicine treatment for gas: Use a drop of peppermint, cinnamon or ginger extract mixed in a cup of water. This recipe relaxes the muscles of the esophagas, allowing gas to escape, if you will pardon my frankness, at either end. I also looked up a site for you on Google and found many more answers for you, should you wish to examine other possibilities.

                "answer_text": "The amount you fart is one of the best indicators of how well you are digesting your food. Farting is in part due to rotting of incompletely digested foods in your digestive passageway. Farting in itself is actually helpful, as it represents unwanted gas leaving your body. In fact, if you have an urge to fart, be sure to do so. The point is, if you are farting a lot, then you probably have a lot of toxin formation occurring inside your gut from rotting of incompletely digested food, and some of these toxins are entering your blood stream and contributing to the development of long term disease. Please note that I am referring to farts that make your family and friends yelp. Farts that do not produce objectionable odor are usually pockets of air that you have swallowed.Enough about farting. What can you do to improve your digestion and prevent toxin formation from rotting of undigested food in your gut?1. Chew your food until liquid. You don\u2019t have teeth anywhere else in your digestive passageway. By chewing your food until liquid, you allow your digestive organs to do their jobs efficiently without the burden of having to break down larger chunks of food. If you don\u2019t remember anything else from this newsletter, please remember this one point. It can make a huge difference in your level of health.2. Consistently eat whole, unprocessed foods. An apple is better than apple juice. A bowl of oatmeal is better than a power bar. An organic egg is better than any egg substitute. And organic butter is much better than margarine. The closer your foods look like they can be found in a garden, in the wild, or on an organic farm, the greater chance your body has of efficiently digesting them.3. Avoid foods that experience tells you no matter how well you chew, your body just says no. Based on your genetics and health status, there are foods that your body will digest beautifully, and there are foods that your body simply cannot break down. It\u2019s your job to observe how you feel after each meal to identify these foods. It is important to note that as your health changes over time, your tolerance for different foods may also change, so you don\u2019t need to write off a particular food forever if it isn\u2019t working for you right now.4. Don\u2019t eat fruit for dessert. Fruits are extremely low in protein compared to all other foods, including vegetables. And all foods that have significant protein must spend about an hour to an hour and a half in your stomach, where the protein is broken down by acid produced by your stomach. If fruit gets caught up in your stomach because there are other foods churning there already, it is possible that some of the fruit will rot, resulting in gas and toxin formation. Try to eat fruit on an empty stomach, or about two hours after a big meal.5. Take it easy for at least 30 minutes after a big meal. In order for your digestive organs to effectively break down food, they need to receive a large portion of your total blood volume after a big meal. If most of your blood is flowing to your muscles because you are running around, you\u2019re not going to have enough available for your digestive organs to do good work.Use the amount that you fart as a marker for your digestive strength and the health of your gut. By following the steps outlined above, you should see a dramatic reduction in gas production.It is important to note that if you are currently eating a lot of processed foods and want to make the jump to eating mainly whole, unprocessed foods, doing so may cause a lot of farting in the beginning. This is due to your intestines and the trillions of bacteria that live in them getting used to a new selection of foods. For many people, it takes about a month to adapt to a whole food diet.",

Also I bet you didn?t know that 5 pounds of fat is about the size of 8 cheese burgers? That alone should be enough to make anyone want to get on the ball and start a change for the better. Weight loss can be really easy to learn but the problem is nobody wants to put the required effort that is needed to actually do it, instead people continually look for (easy) ways to do it. If there was an easy way to lose weight I don?t think 35% of Americans would be obese. There was a time when I also wanted to lose weight and was tired of starting diets only to lose motivation and give up just a few weeks later after seeing no results. However, let me tell you it is literally one of the easiest things you will ever learn once you find a good and reputable place to learn it from and I say that only because the world is filled with magic diet pills, liquid flush diets and a thousand other quick fixes that promise xx pounds of weight loss in the first week and even though it is impossible they know you?re going to do it because your desperate. I have probably tried every diet pill, liquid flush diet, and ab rocket machine known to man and have had no success with any of them nor do I know anyone that has ever had any success with them. I have also tried starving myself which works very well for the first few weeks? right before your metabolism comes to a complete stop and eating just the tiny bit makes you gain weight and you end up weighing more than you did before you started starving yourself. Companies promote weight loss to make money not to get people healthy again and that?s because they know you?re not going to be a customer and buy their products if you?re no longer fat. http://fatloossfactor.com is a site I want you to go to when you have 10 or 20 minutes to spare and I want you to sit down and watch his video on weight loss. He helps people every day to lose weight I have never seen someone as committed as him and that will go so far out of his way to help someone. His weight loss program is one of the best I have ever had the enjoyment of doing and it is without doubt the best success I have ever had with any weight loss program. I also couldn?t be happier with my body right now and I have never felt this wonderful in my whole life. In the end you just got to remember to stick with it and stay confident in yourself and in no time you can achieve the results you have always wanted. It?s not hard to lose weight but most people have a hard time staying motivated and 9 times out of 10 it was because they weren?t really committed from the beginning. Anyways I hope I helped you and I hope you make the commitment to change your body and life. Remember it?s not easy to take the first step but you did, you?re here right now taking it and the rest of the steps will fall into place. Have a wonderful day.",

When your body is hungry and you don't feed it, the body actually thinks there is some sort of a famine and slows down in order to conserve energy. You definitely don't want your body to do that. However, if you're truly not hungry, don't force yourself to eat. The idea of eating 3 meals a day is stupid and isn't part of our innate biology as human beings. In reality, we should graze throughout the day as we become hungry. Keep some low calorie, high protein snacks on you and eat as you feel hungry or symptomatic (as in you feel foggy, grumpy, weak, or whatever you feel when you need to eat). Each person's actual necessary calorie intake is different. Each person changes throughout their life and with varying amounts of physical activity, stress, and illness. The best way to be thinner and healthy is to listen to your body. If you're hungry - eat! If you're not, don't. Also, avoid empty calories and artificial foods. If you have no idea what's in something, you probably shouldn't eat it. Good luck!",

It may occur after taking potent antibiotics, which can wipe out the beneficial bacteria that normally keep yeast in check. It may occur in immunocompromised people, including those undergoing cancer chemotherapy, using steroid medicines or infected with HIV. Diabetics are also more likely to get yeast infections, including thrush.Oral yeast can be easily diagnosed by examining the mouth., It usually forms a thick, white plaque on the tongue or sides of the mouth that can be wiped off. It is treated by using antifungal rinses or lozenges, available by prescription. If you think you have an oral yeast infection, you need to see your doctor for treatment.",

The only thing I know for this, (if thats what it is) is to \"paint\" your mouth with Gentian Violet 1% solution, use according to the directions or what the Dr says. It will look really strange... it makes your mouth bright purple. Then you would want to avoid sugar, beer, and alcohol really.

Although there's no one right age for a girl to get her period, there are some clues that menstruation will start soon. Typically, a girl gets her period about 2 years after her breasts start to develop. Another sign is vaginal discharge fluid (sort of like mucus) that a girl might see or feel on her underwear. This discharge usually begins about 6 months to a year before a girl gets her first period. You will probably feel some moderate symptoms when you first get your period. You may notice that you feel bloated or uncomfortable. This is caused by water that your body retains during menstruation. Other signs that you might start your period include a slight headache, leg ache or backache for a few hours. The most common symptom of getting your period is cramping. You may feel abdominal cramping, similar to a stomach ache for the first few days of your period. Talk to your Mum to get you some over-the-counter pain medication, such as Advil or Tylenol, for the pain if you experience cramping during your first period. You may notice some emotional changes too before your period. You may feel tense, angry, or sad because of the hormones your body is releasing. Don\u2019t get too discouraged. These symptoms won\u2019t last long.Remember that everyone is different so this is only a guideline. It is always a good idea to check with your parents and your doctor if you have any questions.Hope this info helps. Good luck :)",

Addictive behaviors tend to come in clusters, so if you have an eating disorder, a problem with drugs or alcohol, or gambling, you may be a candidate for shopping addiction. Many communities have credit counseling centers that will also help with shopoholism. *Make a shopping list and only buy what is on the list. *Destroy all credit cards except one to be used for emergency only.*Avoid discount warehouses. Allocate only a certain amount of cash to be spent if you do visit one*Window shop\" only after stores have closed. If you do \"look\" during the day, leave your wallet at home. *Avoid phoning in catalog orders and don't watch TV shopping channels*If you're traveling to visit friends or reltives, have your gifts wrapped and call the project finished; people tend to make more extraneous purchases when they shop outside their own communities. *Take a walk or exercise when the urge to shop comes on. *If you feel out of control, you probably are. Seek counseling or a support group such as Debtors Anonymous. *Every compulsive spender is different. Do you spend only occasionally but in big splurges? Or are you on a constant spend-a-thon, moving from one credit card to the next? Do you go nuts for a particular commodity -- electronics, food, jewelry? In order to get a grip, \"You need to admit the particular nature of your problem.\"*What are you shopping for?\" To boost your ego? Relieve depression? Get back at your spouse? Is it a creative outlet or a form of self-expression? Does being at the mall ease loneliness? \"If so, see if you can find other ways to meet those needs.\"*Compulsive spenders face more than financial losses, Ask yourself how much time you spend browsing on the Internet or stalking some great deal. How else could you spend your time in ways that would truly improve your quality of life?*Line up this product you want with some bad buys you have made before, seem similar? thats a bad sign!Try this advice it really helps.... also don't spend on impulse, if you see something you really want come back to the store in 3 weeks, do you still want it? If so how much is it? can you afford it? shop wisely.Hope I helped!",

Having said that, it is never a bad idea to have it checked by your GYN. Endometriosis, in which the uterine lining attaches to the exterior of the uterus and can bind to other organs, can produce a cessation in the cycle, as can polycystic ovary syndrome. There are others as well. Unfortunately I can't tell you exactly when things will normalize, as every woman is different.

You could eat a soft supper that same night. If they are badly impacted, have been infected, and in your mouth for some time, and it takes some manipulation on the part of the oral surgeon to get the puppies out- well, it may be a miserable couple of days afterwards.

Not only these but for RA, OA, Back ache, Ear ache/ringing, Stomach ache and almost all painful diseases. Hence they become chronic.Acidity, WORRY, sadness, excessive wind, cold , heat, sour food and sinusitis, constipation, intestinal inflammation; drug side effects, stress, bad smell, TV & COMPUTER SOMETIMES, Blockage in the flow of Vital Energy, BODY CONSTITUTION etc are their causes.None of them can be treated with medicine.Our 100% success in treating migraine &H/A confirms it.Acupuncture is the best treatment.I can treat it with naturopathy and YOG, but how can you manage pl see.Pain killers don't treat the pain but we loose the sense of pain for some time; in that duration our body itself treats sometime and credit goes to meds.The useless drugs have tremendous power of side effects like liver/kidney failures, ulcer, inflammation of intestines and lot more.Avoid late sleeping if possible; worry, tension, spicy foods, sour fruits, stale bakery foods, SMOKING and alcohole.Sweet foods, COCOANUT WATER,sweet fruits like dates, milk, rice, SPROUTS, SALADS and good sleep will help if cough is not there.But you try one herbal remedy- two drops of drumstick leaves' juice in opposite nostril if one side pains and both nostrils if full H/A will give you rescue. Betel leaf helps but it is very strong.If it is acute pl search a painful point (with round tipped pen/jimmy) 3-6 mm behind your thumb nail and press it, H/A will disappear within 30 seconds.For forehead/eye pain the points are in front of nails on the finger tips or 3-7 mm below.It may disappear naturally too.Source(s):SHREE SWASTHYAYOG TREATMENT, TRAINING & RESEARCH INSTITUTER.H. 19, Jhulelal Society, Sector 2/E, Airoli, Navi Mumbai, INDIA.",

If it is mild, I can just take aspirin or paracetamol and try to sleep it over.If it is really bad, I would take tramadol or ultracet.If it is extremely severe, I would go to my neurologist to get a shot of pain killer (usually pethidine) or get a nerve block.But as the years go by, I realise that I could actually \"catch\" the migraine before it comes. Before a migraine comes, I would usually have a prodrome.A prodrome is like having a particular food craving or mood swings before your migraine comes.If I take metoclopramide during my prodrome, I could lessen the pain of the migraine or sometimes even skip it.Are you on preventatives? Maybe you can try some if you have frequent migraine. You can try preventative medications like topamax or beta blockers like proprananolol or tricyclic like amitriptyline, these are the more common drugs use to prevent migraines.Hope you feel better soon.",

A high-fiber, low-fat breakfast(like oatmeal with skim milk) may make a major contribution to a total reduced food intake for the day.Losing weight is simply a matter of limiting calories consumed and burning off more calories with exercise and daily activities.

                "answer_text": "The key to starting a successful diet plan is to make the changes slowly. You can't go from eating garbage everyday to eating healthy overnight. The changes required to do something like that are huge and should be spread out over a period of time. If you make the changes too quickly, your body won't have time to adjust and you'll probably quit before seeing any results.At first, you shouldn't worry about your calorie count. When you start replacing unhealthy junk with healthy alternatives your calorie count will naturally be reduced because healthy choices are generally lower in calories than unhealthy ones. Start by reducing the amount of junk you eat (chips, cookies, pastries, doughnuts, soda, sugary drinks). Replace unhealthy snacks with nuts, fruits, salads and yogurt.You can then start getting rid of products made from refined flour such as white bread/pasta. Replace these with foods made from 100% whole wheat flour (check the nutrition label). The difference in the two flours is that whole wheat contains more fiber (and vitamins & minerals) which slows down the digestion process. This will keep you full for a longer period of time which will help you eat less throughout the day. Other foods that are high in fiber are fruits, vegetables, oats, beans and legumes.Eventually, you will need to start monitoring your calorie intake. Losing weight depends on you eating less than you burn. If you're not losing weight, the problem is that you're either eating too much, exercising too little or a combination of both.

You need to think about many factors but most of them are related to issues we've known about for a very long time. There are many sensible things you can do that will make a tremendous difference over the long term if you need to lose weight. It can be done in a healthy way. This is what has worked for me.Keeping a food journal really does help. It will give you a much better sense of how much you are eating, and when, and why.Make a few additional small changes - walk everywhere, always use stairs instead of elevators, walk on escalators, get up and move around at least once an hour if your work or your life in general is sedentary, walk every day, use a pedometer. Walking 10,000 steps a day is a really good idea. Build up to a long brisk walk everyday, or most days. Be more active and watch less TV and spend less time on the computer. Buy one piece of exercise equipment to have at home and be strict with yourself about using it. Sometimes you can find mini-steppers or exercise bikes at second hand stores and thrift stores for just a few dollars.Start a weight lifting routine. Join a gym. Possibly you can find one that has someone who specializes in weight lifting programs for beginners. Weight lifting will increase your metabolism as well as improve posture and appearance overall. Even if you can't get to the gym you can work out at home using things around the house. Invest in a good weight training book. The Dummies series actually has a good one. In terms of diet, cut out or reduce things like junk food, pop, fat, fast food. Eat more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean meat, fish. Particularly if you choose a vegetarian lifestyle include natural peanut butter, hummus, dried fruit and nuts. Pay close attention to getting the nutrients your body needs to be healthy. Make your portion sizes smaller. Use a smaller plate - in our society we have become accustomed to thinking that we need a large plate of food at every meal, and we don't. About quarter of your plate of food should be protein and at least half of it should be veggies. Learn to count calories. At your current weight and activity level, you may possibly need about 2000 calories or more to maintain your current weight. So you will lose weight at a reasonable and healthy rate if you cut back to about 1600 or 1700 calories a day. Eat small amounts frequently, rather than three large meals. Never skip breakfast. Include some protein in your breakfast. It will help get you through the day.Drink plenty of water, at least 8 big glasses of water a day, and more if it is very hot, if you sweat a lot, or if you are exercising intensely, and eliminate fruit juices. Fruit juices have too many calories, so get your vitamins from fresh fruit, not the juice. You will begin to see changes in your body. Vary your routines. Don't eat the same number of calories every day (vary your calories from 1400 a day to 1900 or 2000 some days), eat a variety of foods, and do different kinds and amounts of exercise. You will lose weight much more efficiently if you mix things up from time to time so that your body doesn't adjust to any one routine.An area that many people overlook is getting enough sleep. You are much more likely to overeat or to binge eat if you are tired and not well rested, so get enough sleep.Check out websites about nutrition, exercise, weight training, etc. Here are a few helpful links.http://www.nutrawatch.com/http://www.caloriesperhour.com/http://www.helpguide.org/life/healthy_eating_diet.htmhttp://www.wikihow.com/Lose-Weight-the-Healthy-Wayhttp://weightloss.about.com/cs/fitness/a/aa011503a.htmhttp://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/features/no-weight-workout?page=4",

I lost around 50 pounds using just these simple tips I'm about to explain to you.I found three things to be the best but you have to use them together in order to get some great results. You have to understand that you are what you eat first. Dieting is something you might have to stick in there with and follow through with one. Some people can while others can't.The next thing you need to do is create a workout plan whether that be cardio or some other exercise to get the heart rate up. You have got to do at least 30 mins a day to get some results.The 3rd step that I'm going to explain, helps a lot if you are slobbish on your diet or just need some help with it all. For me, it's a natural herbal supplement called Proactol. It's a fat binder and an appetite suppressant. I'm very health consicious and having this supplement that is made from natural herbs, you really can't beat it. It's helped me so much but absorbing up to 28% of fat that you intake. Which means if you aren't following your dieting plans, you have a little more room for food being on the supplement. The appetite suppressant part works wonderfully too so you can actually stay away from the cookies and brownies.These steps really worked for me, you should try them out for yourself even if you want to lose very little or that extra mile. Also at the time of my 3 month supply purchase of Proactol, I saved a lot of money on it at http://theweightlossplace .comGood luck and I hope this helps you out for your weight loss goals.",

If it's any of your other fingers just go to your local drug store and buy some finger splints - preferable ones that are padded on top and bottom, the sides can be open. and medical tape - talk to the pharmacist if you're in doubt on what you're looking for. Keep it splinted and taped for a week or so, and then pull the splint off and see how you feel (other than just stiffness). If it still hurts or anything see a doctor for an x-ray. I broke my finger a month ago, splinted it myself for a few weeks, and was all better in 2 weeks. Good Luck.",

Often, they hang out with people they would never have given the time of day to, until they wanted to get high. I have seen weed sap people of ambition....twenty years later, they still have not actively pursued any of the dreams they used to have. It seems that boredom actually kicks us in the rear and gets us to achieve more. When you get high-voila! No longer bored. That gives you the illusion that something is happening, when in fact very little outside your own head is taking place. It can also cause panic attacks.

I think its a waste of my taxes to incarcerete some harmless smoker when we could be directing money into more important things like finding and jailing meth/coke addicts, killers, rapists, etc......People who do stupid things and smoke pot do stupid things because of their natural intellect, not the drug. It's like a placebo, they think pot makes them stupid, therefore the act dumb, their faking it. It does nothing to harm the body (yes, smoke is bad for lungs) it won't make you impotent or kill brain cells, harm fetuses, ets. It does do some other things though, of course it depends on the person. It can increase appitite, help with sleep disorders, helps people cope with pain (mental/physical), etc. The comercials on tv (BTW I think they should be making to commercials about different drugs that actually do the things that the commercials are implying pot does... I have never felt the urge to leave my friends on a corner, lick a cats rear, or get bad grades while high-I'm an honor student BTW- ) are just trying to freak kids out by telling lies. Well, get with the program, it's 2009 and society changes, if humans want to make the choice to smoke pot, let them, I mean its legal to kill yourselves with alcohal and un-natural cigeretts, which are 100X more harmfull than pot. Last, if it was legal, we wouldn't have to deal with Mexicans (others too) illegaly going into California to grow, sell, and send money earned to a different country. It would save money, time, energy, etc. Besides, it wouldn't be soo exciting if it was legal, and kids would be more open to talk about it their parental figures if they knew the wouldn't go to jail/get in trouble for doing it.sorry bout all that, it's something I feel strongly about :)",

Your penis size will be the size you are given! There are no pills or creams, no toys or tools that will make a penis longer or larger. Any product claiming to do that should be regarded as being suspect. Likely it is a scam and the only thing that will get bigger is the wallet or bank account of the person/company offering the product. Look closely at the promotions and you will see that the product is not tested, inspected, approved or endorsed by any reputable organization. If it works why has it not been submitted to the U.S. Federal Food and Drug Administration for FDA Approval. If you are concerned that your penis is not large enough then consider that the average length is 5.5 inches and frankly that is plenty large enough. Read some of the posts from females who are afraid of the \"huge\" penises out there. Sure the \"American thing\" is \"bigger is better\" but that is not always the case. If you are concerned about the ladies pleasure - and that should be your main concern, you should develop a technique or style that makes the most out of what you were given. It is important to remember that sexual intercourse is not simply a piston going back and forth at a high speed. Actually a lot of the \"jocks\" haven't figured that out yet. If you work at developing a style you will score more and it will be more fun for both of you.And it will be fun learning the technique.And if you are still wanting to do something to make your penis bigger, each night before you climb into bed, get down on your knees, bow your head, and pray for a larger penis. Trust me, you stand a better chance this way than with any tools or toys.",

If this doesn't help, you might want to try setting your alarm for 6:30 instead. People sleep in cycles. You might be falling into an REM cycle right at 7 o'clock and those are the worst to wake up from. You might want to try resetting your internal clock by going to bed a little earlier.

The makle needs to overcome the urge to shopot his semen. If he does shoot then he can also recover and go for round two. Taking your time is best, and everyone is different but making love all day long is the very best.Gilrs can have several events to climax, but males go through a phase after they reach their goal where the cannot continue without recharging. Practice makes perfect so mastubation teaches both males and females how to get what they need to reach the very top of performance. It is people who do not practice on themselves...

If and when you try to conceive you will have a very hard time doing so...Don't put it off any longer go to the doctor so they can test for pregnancy if it's negative they might need to do other tests such as your prolactin, thyriod, LH and FSH ect....Their could be numerous reasons why your not getting a period not just pregnancy...Like i said i have always been irregular i would have a period inbetween 1-5 months then they all of a sudden stopped and i was not pregnant nor was anything wrong my body all looked perfect...I put it off for soo long and now that my hubby and i want to have a child we haven't been able to conceive and we have been trying for about a year so far and now i have to see an infertility specialist",

You might be dying or something bad like that.But to *actually* *answer* your question, yeah, I think it could be appendicitis. I had it when I was like YY or YY. It lasted a full week (actually, 8 days) before I went to the E.R. and I wasn't \"doubled over in pain\" like some people suggest you would be. That doesn't really happen until it bursts. Then you die a short time later. But anyway, it was pain on both sides of my lower and middle abdomen, like from both my left and right hips, up to my navel. There was also some dull pain in my lower abdomen, towards the back. like I was a little backed up. I didn't lose my appetite until day eight. I went to bed feeling okay the night before, and woke up the next day so listless that I didn't consume any thing except one glass of water and I slept for an additional ten or twelve hours.My point is that patients can present atypical symptoms, so it might be your appendix, or something else serious.EDIT: I'm pretty disgusted by the people answering this question when they really don't know what they're talking about. You don't die 24 hours after getting Appendicitis. Maybe 24 hours after it bursts, and then you'll probably die without treatment. But regardless of whether it has burst or not, it needs to come out if it is Appendicitis. BTW, after sitting in the ER for six or seven hours, I had a fifteen minute CT scan. That's all it takes for a diagnosis. Do some research before you answer. Come on.",
