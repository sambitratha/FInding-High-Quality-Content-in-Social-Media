Eat lots of vegetables (particularly green ones) and some fruit. Also eat lean protein (nuts, lean meat, legumes, tofu, low fat dairy etc).

Avoid white bread/pasta/rice and swap with wholemeal bread/pasta and brown rice.
Avoid sugary things. Try using artifical sweetner instead but don't overdo it of course.

 Gym Routine for Toning Up & Weight Loss

Working  out at the gym can improve your fitness level, develop muscle
tone and help you lose weight if follow a plan. Outline your course of
action  to  include  the five components of a balanced fitness routine
and your time will be well spent.

The Five Components
The  five  components  to  a  balanced  routine include cardiovascular
endurance,  strength  training,  flexibility,  core-strengthening  and
balance.  You  do  not need to incorporate all five elements into your
training  every  time you workout, but you will want to make sure they
have  been  included  during  the  course  of several days. You should
include  cardiovascular  workouts  three  to  five  times per week and
strength training twice a week, that is a good schedule to start with.

Monday, Wednesday, Friday: Cardio
On  these  three  days,  you will want to use a cardio machine at your
gym.  A good choice for beginner through advanced-level fitness is the
elliptical   machine.   Other   options   are  the  stationary  bikes,
stair-steppers  and  treadmills. Your cardiovascular workout will last
for  20  minutes.  Start  out going at about 50 percent of the maximum
exertion  you  are capable of -- or level five out of 10. Stay at this
moderate  level  for  two  minutes,  then  increase either your speed,
resistance  or  incline to make your exertion more difficult, or level
six  for  one minute. Continue increasing your level of difficulty for
one  minute intervals until you reach 90 percent of your maximum, then
return  back  to  level  six for one minute. When you are on your last
interval  cycle,  or  when you hit 19 minutes, give 100 percent effort
for  one  minute.  Then  take  it  down  to a level four for your last
minute. You will want to stay at this lower exertion level long enough
to  return  to  as  close  to your normal breathing as possible before
ending your cardio workout.
 
Monday, Wednesday, Friday: Resistance
You  want  to make sure to include all of you major muscle groups over
the course of the week if you do not include them all daily. The major
groups   are   back,  chest,  legs,  abdominal,  biceps,  triceps  and
shoulders.  Remember  to work opposing muscle groups such as chest and
back.  If  there  is a chance you might miss a day, try to include all
the  major groups each time you workout. Also, alternate between using
free-weights and machines for even greater variety and faster results.
Do  three sets of weight-bearing exercises per muscle group. The first
set  should  be  heavy, but comfortable. For you that might be a bicep
curl  that weighs 10 lbs.; do 12 repetitions. The second set should be
heavier  than  the  first so try 12 lbs.; do 10 repetitions. The third
set  should  be your heaviest and it should be difficult to finish; do
eight reps.
 
Tuesday and Thursday
Some  trainers  will  tell  you  that interval training burns the most
calories  and  others  will  tell you hard and fast cardio is the best
training to lose weight. Do both and you wont have to worry. Pick your
machine;  you  will  want  to  work  out  at  an exertion level around
75-percent of your maximum ability for a solid 40 to 45 minutes with a
five  minute cool down at about a level five out of 10. These are good
days  to  do  abdominal  exercises  if  you  did not have time on your
interval days. Use a stability ball to do 25 crunches, four times, for
instance. Spend at least 10 minutes after your workout stretching.
 
Saturday and Sunday
Take  Saturday  to  enjoy an activity with your family or to have fun.
Make it something where you will get your heart-rate up, but you might
not  consider  it  a  workout. Consider roller-skating, dog-walking or
bicycling. And on Sunday, let your body rest. Your body needs a day to
recuperate  so  that  you can continue your fast-track towards meeting
your fitness goals.",0,0,True,

For example they happen more in teenage years but lot less later one in mature men. All depends on your level or arousal and libido.

"hey everybody. I'm an YY year old guy from the netherlands and I'm really depressed. I want to kill myself very soon, probably by jumping off a building. My situation is as followed: I have been depressed for about 3 years now but no one ever knew. I have my ways of hiding it I guess. It never even got in the way school-wise (grades and such) until this year. I quit college a few weeks ago because of it. I've always ran away from it using animes, cartoons, games and marijuana (I'm not a pothead though). I comfortably could flee to my own perfect fantasy world. Right now my parents are very disappointed and shocked that I never told them about it, which I did about two weeks ago. The fights with my parents are getting worse, especially with my mom.

I kind of resolved the situation between my parents by opening up them about everything I felt, how I felt about them , I think you should get counselling or talk to a professional about how you feel
Your parents need to acknowledge that you need help, instead of treating you like that

They should've worked out the change in your behaviour from the beginning and instead of dwelling on the fact that you hid it from them, you probably found it hard admitting it yourself, right? They should work out a solution for you

Oh yeah





Don't kill yourself...

All people have ups & downs. You are not alone. When I was younger I also had some tough times. Know you have a friend - me - & a bright future. If things are bad, things can only get better. Right? You are a special person. People love you much more than you think. 

Seek help from people & G-d, solve problems, be patient & you will overcome them & be a better person for it. Your life will improve and pain will subside and you will live a more meaningful existence. ""This will also pass."" 

I am sorry about your situation. We can overcome any problem. You can too. I believe you can! Certain things can make life easier:

1. Recognize the Good in Life 

Make a list of all the good that you have in life. Know that G-d is providing you with everything, Like: 
Your life, your family, your car, your house, your food, your air, your clothes, your water, your functioning body, your education, your money, your world, your pets, your computer, your electricity, your senses, your brain, your ability to think, etc. 

Don't be lead just by the heart. Use your mind to direct your life & let your heart follow. See: 

Set Yourself Free – Breaking Out of a Negative Mindset & Anxiety 
http://jerusalemlife.com/?p=2284 

2. Recognize the good in You 

Realize your importance. If you saw a person drowning, G-d Forbid, would you probably would try to save them. This shows you are a caring person. Seek help from others instead of hurting yourself. Aren't you just as important than a drowning person? 

Take a paper & write all your good qualities & characteristics. Hang it your wall to appreciate yourself daily. 

If you want a list of good qualities that you can just circle: 
Appreciating Your Own Greatness – Feeling Good About Yourself 
http://jerusalemlife.com/?p=2926 

At the Jerusalem Life site you can order the You are special card to remind you of how special you are. 
http://jerusalemlife.com/?wpsc-product=y... 

3. People Love You. Talk it with Others 

Please don't hurt yourself. Be patient & things will get better. Speak with friends or family, a social worker, a trusted psychologist and/or an orthodox rabbi about your concerns & they will help soothe your concerns. People want to help. Have the courage to reach out. Please reach out for your own good. Make friends with good people. Choose friends & family that bring you up not down. 

4. Solve Your Problems Slowly & Patiently 

Write down : What is the problem? What are the causes? What are possible solutions? Implement these solutions. Be patient & recognize even small improvements. Life doesn't usually change overnight, but things get better & you start seeing light in life little by little. 

5. G-d Loves You - Reach out to G-d & He will help you 

Jews believe & know that G-d is Good. Sometimes problems arise to wake you up to become closer to Hash-m / G-d. You have a Father in Heaven & He wants you to seek Him. When make an effort to solve your problems and try to become closer to Him problems many times are solved. G-d appreciates when you reach out to Him. 

G-d loves the people he created. You are a person that G-d created. Meaning G-d loves you. Developing a relationship with Him opens up a new dimension in your life. He has the power to do everything to make your life better. You Just have to pray to Him. 

G-d created the Universe. He is omniscient & omnipotent. Jews believe that G-d has no physical or spiritual shape or form. Abraham taught anything that has a weakness or limitation cannot be G-d. He taught it is impossible for G-d to be an object, star, animal, plant or person. 

You can always start over. Here is an article on Starting Over – Wiping the Slate Clean in Judaism 
http://jerusalemlife.com/?p=1357 

Pray to the G-d of the Universe - that gave the Jews the Torah - the God of Abraham, Isaac & Jacob. I heard a story of a woman that went to see my friend - a Doctor. She was proud to say she was following the Seven Noahide laws. He asked her why? She said was not answered when she prayed to other ""gods"". When she prayed to the G-d of the Jews, she was answered. 

6. Seek Answers to Your Questions 

You can also search or contact the Jewish sites about your life questions or for help like: 
http://aish.com 
http://jerusalemlife.com 

7. Do Good, Be Good & Feel Good 

When you do kindness to others you feel better about yourself. 

For Jews I would recommend joining an Orthodox Synagogue to be part of the community. There one can Volunteer for Bikur Holim - Visiting the Sick, or Participate or help Organize Torah Lectures, or Teach others Hebrew or about Judaism. Opportunities abound. Be part of the Community. 

For Gentiles I would suggest learning about the & Noahide laws & joining a Noahide community. 

For Both I would suggest doing something productive daily like working at a Job & focus on helping people. 

Follow the 7 Noahide Commandments for all humanity according to the Torah. They are called such because they were given to Noah - by G-d to assure the peace & proper functioning of the world. Gentiles don't have to convert to Judaism to receive a place in heaven: they just have to follow the 7 Noahide laws. A gentile / non-Jew that follows them because of the Torah is considered a ""Righteous Gentile."" The Seven Noahide Laws are seven major categories – that with their details consist of 30 laws. 

1) Respecting G-d – Not to blaspheme. 
2) Being Faithful to G-d – Not to Commit Idolatry. 
3) Respecting Human Life – Not to Kill. 
4) Respecting One’s Fellow’s Property – Not to Steal. 
5) Respecting the Integrity of the Family – Not to commit forbidden relations – which includes prohibitions of adultery, incest, bestiality & homosexuality. 
6) Respect of Life – Not to eat a limb taken from a living animal. 
7) Law & Order – Establishing courts of law to enforce these laws. 

The Torah is the law that G-d gave to the Jews in front of millions of witnesses, It was the only time in history that he gave a law to an entire nation. G-d never did & never does change his ""mind."" 

http://www.aish.com/jl/jnj/nj/ 
http://noahidenations.com 
http://asknoah.org 

Remember also G-d forgives when a person sincerely repents. Even if a person did bad in their life they can Start Over. 

8. Suffering Passes & is for a Purpose 

A Wise Man said to a person who had ups & downs in life ""This will also pass."" When in pain remember ""This will also pass."" Print it out in big letters & keep it on a wall to remind you. 

A person gets used to tough times or learns to cope, or learns to appreciate it or it passes altogether. King David used to appreciate difficulty, because he in it he would feel a closeness to G-d. 

Butterflies are beautiful. They enter a cocoon to emerge as a beautiful creature. At times suffering helps a person to introspect about how to improve & they emerge as a beautiful person. 

Suffering helps us gain a clearer perspective. I used to think life's goal was to ""Get rich, Be Popular & Make waves."" After my pains, I realized G-d wants us to be a Good person. To use our talents to help others. To Bring out our best & curb our desires that bring us sometimes off the road of happiness. 

Try to use the suffering to become closer to G-d & to become a better person. Your suffering is for a purpose. It is not in vain. I found it out from experience. We only see life in a limited perspective - G-d sees it from the beginning of time till the end of time. Your difficulties will make you stronger & allow you to become a greater success - because you went through difficulty & overcame it. 

Because life is difficult it doesn't mean that it is bad. A person suffers to get an education but in the end they reap fruits. Suffering opens new doors that one would have not considered before. I experienced suffering & it allowed me to become closer to G-d & spirituality. 

9 Seek to Satisfy Your Soul - Spiritual Renewal through Torah 

A person is really a soul not a body. Spirituality is feeling a closeness to G-d. The soul at times feels sad sue to a lack of spirituality. It may feel it is not performing it's purpose. You have a purpose in the world & you achieve it by following & learning the commandments of the Torah. 

Some pleasures make the soul happy & pleasures that make the soul sad. Do the pleasures that make the soul happy, like the 7 commandments mentioned above. Help people. Do Kindness. Help your family. Get a Job. Do projects that will help others. You can ask an orthodox Rabbi if you want to know of good projects. 

If You are Jewish Learn Torah & speak with an orthodox Rabbi to learn more & call to Hash-m & he will help you. If you are not, learn the 7 Noahide laws speak with an orthodox Rabbi to guide you & call to Hash-m & he will help. Try to do simple Mitzvot - Like saying the Food blessings, or saying Shema in the Morning and Night. Listen to some Jewish Music. 

When suffering I used to go to the Public library & read Jewish short story books from Orthodox Jewish sources to soothe me. I would also go to Jewish bookstores. Reading the stories helped me to cope & see life in different perspective & change myself for the good. Some good sources to purchase books are Artscroll & Feldheim Publishers. 

If you are Jewish I would suggest you learn the Pirkei Avot / Ethics of the Fathers. If you are not Jewish, I would suggest you read the Path of the Righteous Gentile: 
http://amazon.com/The-Path-Righteous-Gentile-Introduction/dp/087306433X/
Both works teach how to live life with more meaning. 

10. Please make an Effort to Care for Yourself Because G-d Cares about You 

You are one of G-d's creations & He loves his creations. G-d wants you to live and enjoy life. People do care about you. I am one of them. Hope this helps. & I hope everything works out for the best for you. You have a friend. 

All the best.

A. Take a deep and continuous breath: Take deep breaths to calm yourself down. Stop thinking about what is making you angry and take a nice deep breath and hold it for a second or two... then breathe out slowly. Do this for 8 to 10 inhalations and exhalations.

B. Do some physical exercises: When you are angry, your body is very tensed and tough. If you stretch your muscles it will relax your body, and release your negative energy. Your brain will get more oxygen and assist you in clearing your thoughts.

C. Be Grateful: Find things to be grateful for. Be grateful that you have woken up today. Thank the Sun for shining, and realize there are people in your life that love you.

D. Meditation: Meditation is easy to learn. About 5 to 7 minutes of practice a day is all you need. You will notice that you get less angry the more you practice meditation.

He said: “Let anger alone and leave rage; do not show yourself heated up only to do evil.” (Psalm 37:8) The way to avoid saying or doing something that you may later regret is to keep from getting “heated up” in the first place. Of course, that is much easier said than done. But it can be done! Let’s consider three ways that you can get your anger under control.

“Let Anger Alone”.
To reduce anger, slow down and relax. Try to avoid saying the first thing that comes to mind. If you feel yourself getting overly excited and feel you are in danger of losing control of your emotions, apply the Bible’s counsel: “The beginning of contention is as one letting out waters; so before the quarrel has burst forth, take your leave.”—Proverbs 17:14.

“Learn to Relax.
A calm heart is the life of the fleshly organism.” (Proverbs 14:30) Applying this basic Bible truth can improve one’s emotional, physical, and spiritual health. Start by learning simple relaxation methods, which help to reduce feelings of anger. The following techniques p. 9have proved to be effective in combating stress-related anger:
 ● Breathing deeply, which is one of the best—and fastest—ways to reduce the intensity of your anger.
 ● While breathing deeply, repeating a word or phrase that is calming to you, such as “relax,” “let it go,” or “take it easy.”
 ● Immersing yourself in something you enjoy—perhaps reading, listening to music, gardening, or some other type of activity you find relaxing.
● Getting regular exercise and eating a healthful diet.

Adjust Your Expectations. 
You may not be able completely to avoid the people or the things that act as anger triggers, but you can learn to control your reactions to them. This involves changing the way you think.As imperfect humans, we all get angry from time to time. But how we express our anger is a matter of choice. The apostle Paul cautioned fellow Christians: “Be wrathful, and yet do not sin; let the sun not set with you in a provoked state.” (Ephesians 4:26) Yes, by controlling our anger, we can express our feelings in a positive way, a way that works for the benefit of everyone involved.",1,0,True,JW.org

YOU SAID: ""Please, don't ever think about killing yourself again, and if you do, the best thing i can say is, reach out to you're parents and ask them to see a doctor, if your parents are very close minded about things like this, what i did was i told my mom i had a health problem and needed to get my family doctor to check in out and told her she cant come in with me and once i was alone i told her the truth, then this is beyond your parents once ANY doctor has heard under 18 or not, you will get the help you need my parents were okay, with it some may or may not be its all up to how your parents are :)

Now, killing yourself, and bullying its hard trust me, i know its hard, i was bullied since i was in school pretty much and now im YY, what you need to do is, try and make a friend just ONE friend in school, outside school believe it or not one friend can help you so much, you can vent to them, you can call them and cry to them, trust me they help, and you need to tell someone about getting bullied i know it may not look ""Good"" socially but that doesnt matter who knows how many other people their bullying? you could help end that. 

Now im happy you went to a adult, a lot of kids dont, they like to isolate themselves against well everything, i know it may be hard but try to reach out to a trusted adult, like your parents, a teacher (Who feels strong about topics like this, (Bullying,Suicide) I know in my school all my English teachers are like this) and they will help, just tell them how much your getting bullied.

Its a hard life, but stay strong okay? And heres a website im on all the time when i need want to be alone but still need someone to tell me they love me. (You stay completely anonymous!)

I don't think that you need to be worried. Stay calm. 

Try drinking a liter of water, you may be dehydrated, and if not, check what type of material you have in your underwear. Go for unscented, all cotton. 

Make sure that you clean the area, as something may be irritated (can be from strange materials, or swimming in weird water, etc).

I understand how awkward it can be, but just tell your dad that you have to go to the doctor's. Like Amelie and Mary Kontrarry said, just say it's a feminine issue. They don't want to know. Lol guys are wimps. If he asks, like really asks, tell him he doesn't want to know. Granted, he'll think its about your period, but it'll work.

Good luck!!!

And how true this is of masturbation

Because of the changes taking place within his or her body, a youth can become sexually excited even when he or she is not necessarily thinking about sex
. Among boys, for instance, the tensions produced by various worries, fears, or frustrations can affect their sensitive nervous systems and cause sexual arousal.
 A buildup of semen may in turn produce a nocturnal emission (wet dream), usually accompanied by an erotic dream, or cause a boy to awaken sexually excited
. Similarly, some young girls may find themselves stimulated accidentally. And a young woman may have a heightened sexual desire just before or after her menstrual period.

So, often it is what one reads, watches, or listens to for entertainment, talks about, or meditates on, that makes it hard to avoid masturbation. Therefore, being careful about what you take into your mind is essential to break this habit.

For some people masturbation may become a habit to which they turn for solace whenever they are rebuffed or feel apprehensive about something. Others, however, may withdraw in this way only occasionally, when they are under the most acute emotional stress.”

A high proportion of masturbatory experiences are motivated less by erotic needs than by general anxiety, tension, and boredom for which it becomes a sought-for tranquilizer

.” So when one is upset, depressed, lonely, or under much stress this habit becomes a convenient “tranquilizer” to blot out one’s troubles. (Compare Proverbs 31:6, 7.) 

Therefore, to avoid masturbation, you must recognize this as an immature way to deal with problems and be willing to 

The urge to resort to masturbation for sheer pleasure when things are not going well in one’s life can easily cause one to become a ‘senseless slave to various desires and pleasures.’ (Titus 3:3)

 Yet, the apostle Paul states: “I will not let myself be brought under authority by anything.” (1 Corinthians 6:12) He was not going to let his desires become like a harsh master.

 On the contrary, Paul wrote: “I pummel my body [fleshly desires] and lead it as a slave.” (1 Corinthians 9:27) He got tough with himself! A similar effort will enable anyone to break free from masturbation—regardless of how hard that is to do.

 I hope this helps

Dealing with depression can be difficult, but it is not impossible feel better. The good news is that depression can be treated in a healthy way with using your coping skills, medication (if needed) and/or counseling. What we mean by coping skill's are to do things that make you feel good about yourself and that you enjoy. Some suggestions we encourage you to try are to exercise, read, journal your feelings, listen to music, and watch TV or a movie. Using healthy coping skills will help with your depression, keep you busy, and distract your thoughts from whatever you are going through. Sometimes with feel it is others (family and friends) that make us happy, but this is not true. We are all responsible for our own happiness.

I know how you feel okay.. I&#x27;ve been in a kinda depression for the last 8 month..
My mom and stepdad, who has been my father since I was 6 (I&#x27;m almost YY) broke up :( 
My stepdad got really mad because of some private stuff, and he literally turned into a monster..
He smashed up our yard, stole our house key, sended my mom death threats, stole our bikes and a lot more.. 
We needed to get the police to talk to him and know my mom wants to move to another city.. But I don&#x27;t, because then I have to leave all my friends :(
I also lost my dog, who was my best friend..
I keep disappointing my mom and feels like I can&#x27;t do anything right.. 
But opposite from you, I have friends, but I don&#x27;t really talk about my problems with them.. I don&#x27;t like that..
But anyway, you need to get away from the suicidal thought and out of cutting.. I cutted too once, but I got out..
You need to try to focus on good stuff, even tho it&#x27;s really hard! :(

Never give up on yourself; you are a valuable person. 

It's so important that you immediately reach out for support from a trusted adult such as a parent,  school counselor, teacher, coach, or minister.  We would suggest getting evaluated by a medical doctor or mental health professional, and getting involved in counseling.   Please contact 911 if you need immediate assistance.

The brain is a very complicated and delicate thing.  It can get messed up and be unable to produce sufficient serotonin.  This is called a chemical imbalance which is easily treated, very common and nothing to be ashamed of.  

It can cause depression, anxiety, panic, obsession, self harm/self hatred, suicidal thoughts, eating disorders, sleeping problems, aggression/rage, anger, phobias, fears, helplessness, hopelessness, hypochondria, ADHD, paranoia, OCD, headaches, lack of interest in things, lack of motivation/ focus and much more.

According to those who have gone to therapists, counseling and therapy dont help much.  They are not even allowed to prescribe appropriate meds to help you get better. 

You dont need therapy but you DO need a dr.  He/she is the only one who can help.  Tell dr. about your symptoms and ask for anti-depressants.  Zoloft/Sertraline is a good one; most people thrive on it and it has no side effects.  It enables the brain to function properly.  

With the right antidepressants, you will be much better, happier, calmer, confident, relaxed, normal and self mutilation will no longer have a strangle-hold on you.  What a difference it makes!!   You need them, so stay ON them.  Youve tried everything else, so why not give meds a try.

Then, find a big happy church, attend some groups there and have fun.  Talk with the pastor/minister or the youth pastor/leader.  They have more wisdom than you and I.  And where else can you get FREE counseling?

This is hard to deal with especially when you have become addicted to the pain that you inflict on yourself.  if you are not getting help from a counselor you should maybe try that.  Finding someone to help you step by step will help. Have you share this with any of your family?  You don't have to be alone.  it sounds like your friend is worried about you.  Hold onto that friendship. They can be there for you as well.  

You should come up with a safety plan for yourself, one you can follow when ever these thoughts of cutting come up.  Maybe have a list of people you can call (you can even use a crisis hotline as well.)  You can also have on that plan an idea of what else you can try.  Some people find that removing themselves from the items they use to cut work so going for a walk helps.  You can also try using a rubber band or piece of ice on your skin in the places you want to cut.  Sometimes the pain will help with the urge.  

Try to remember that you can help yourself by believing in yourself and knowing that you can get better.  It is not going to be an easy road.  You may even want to get involved with an outpatient program for more support.  You can do it though.  Just remember that.

Most people that harm themselves is because of the emotional pain they feel. There is no pill, ointment or bandaid that can take away an emotional pain and if the person is not skilled enough with how to cope with strong negative emotions they turn to a pain that is more familiar to them and is easily treatable and it also helps them focus on the physical pain that is more real because the body is injured, 

What seems to be the case with you is that you are looking for help, but the help you really need is from a professional who has experience and understanding of those who self-harm. Normally when someone suggests therapy it drums up an image of lying on a couch and a Froidian looking person asking his patient to tell them about their childhood and their parents and any emotional trauma they have experienced while very young. That is no longer the case for therapy, and the therapy that is usually reccomended is counselling rather than seeing a psychologist.

What has happened to you is you have had an experience that you have not been able to cope with and you have behaved in the only way you know by self-harming. The physical pain supresses the emotional pain but that emotional pain resurfaces all the time because the physical pain only covers the emotional pain, it doesn't heal the emotional pain.

You are looking for help because you are finding that your coping mechanism is becoming a problem along with your emotional paint.The help you need requires long term commitment which can be agreed upon between you and a cousellor. 

So you don't worry about what happens during a couselling ssession I will let you know what happens in a couselling session.

When the client meets the counsellor they draw up a mutaul contract. The cousellor will tell you all that you tell them is confidential but the only thing that cannot be kept confidential is if you intend to commit a criminal act that would seriously harm yourself or somebody else (self-harming is not considered a criminal act unless you are determined to take your own life). The counsellor will also set a time for how long the session will last for that first session.

Once that has been agreed upon the counsellor will let you talk about anything you want to talk about. If you find you can't think of anything to talk about the cousellor might ask how your day was. It becomes a conversation but the client does most of the talking. The counsellor will understand that you might not have revealed the core root of what has caused you to self-harm, it may be that you need time to trust the counsellor to determine if they are genuine or not, if what you tell them is going to be held in the strictest of confidentiality or if they are going to report you to your parents at the first opportunity. Counsellors cannot reveal anything the client said in a counselling session without the clients permission.

When you feel comfortable about talking about your self harm the counsellor will support you to find the solutions to your problems.",2,0,False,

Stay away from junk, caffeine, alcohol, drugs, and other stimulant. Be very careful with prescription drugs. Eat plenty of fresh fruits.

I had nothing to showcase as my achievements, I repeatedly kept disappointing everyone, and I felt like I was no good at anything at all.

There is always a way, and you are not alone. (Not giving you any philosophical ****, just the truth)
Find something that you're good at. There has to be something, for everyone. Pursue that.
Make your stand in the world, hold your head high and give yourself a reason to be proud of yourself.
And never listen to what society says to you. Okay, I know I am a part of it, but never listen to the mean words, the insults, the jibes, the fun making, anything negative. Give them a blind eye and a deaf ear.
And believe in yourself.

Sleeping pills can give you bad side effects such as headaches and drowsiness during the day so you are better off without them. 

To sleep better just relax and switch off, if you can.

Include spirituality into your life and lead life as per spirituality to be a happy and content human now.

To lead a happy life, just chant the name of the god according to the religion of birth, go here ssrf.org

Also don't forget to chant ""SHREE GURU DEVA DATTA"". This is a protective chant which will protect you, believe me.

I have really bad anxiety and it affects my life a lot... it stops me from sleeping and makes me feel extremely depressed and down... is there anything I can do to stop worrying constantly and actually relax and be happy with nothing negative on my mind for once... ??,How to over come anxiety?,20140310183238AAmBXar,1394501558,9,27,26,1394593057,"There's a few things you can do (I just lost my mother in Nov. 2013 & have been struggling with bipolar disorder + depression for over 10 years, so TRUST ME when I say that these things have worked for me, so they can def. work for you too) : 
1. Meditate (it sounds corny but it actually does work)
2. Seek counseling. Most states offer free counseling programs, that include giving free anxiety meds and/or talking to qualified awesome professionals. 
3. Always keep an open circle of trusted friends/family you can talk to. Sometimes being able to vent to unbiased people is the best therapy!!
4. If your sleep is completely off, take a sleep aid (Tylenol PM for example). Of course you can't take them forever, but they def. offer a quick run start
5. Do some yoga or exercise. People don't realize how doing the small things can greatly affect the mind in a positive way. 
6. Get to the root of your depression. When did it start? What/who are your triggers? Do the emotional homework & get to the deep rooted problem of your depression/anxiety. The depression itself is the ""symptom"" of the problem, NOT the root cause of the problem. You'd be surprised at how freeing it is when you can at least acknowledge the true source of the problem (the 1st step in getting help) 
7. Go back to doing all the things you stopped doing. Depression fatigues people, makes them go into the shadows & makes them lose interest in things/people they normally would've still been doing. Keep yourself distracted & FORCE yourself to go out & have fun. Don't isolate yourself no matter how much you want to b/c it'll just lead to a false sense of feeling like you're alone. If you used to write, go to karaoke, or go to really fun places or hang out with really fun friends before all the anxiety started, go back & do those things 
8. Go to a support group or do some research on depression. The best feeling in the world is when you realize that not only are you not alone, but there are people out there who face the same demons as you, if not worse! Just having someone you can relate to, especially if they've overcome the same demons you're trying to overcome, is probably the most effective methods to abolish depression (i.e. the advice I'm giving you)
9. If you're a spiritual or religious person, pray. Ask God to remove the depression, loneliness & anxiety from your spirit & body. 
10. Funny vines & videos are taking over the social media scene. Watching all the funny vines, videos & seeing all the hilarious memes has really helped me in grieving the death of my mother & my bipolar disorder
11. And keep doing what you're doing! It's great that you're asking for help & for solutions b/c that means that you're more strong & courageous than you think! We've all got demons of all kinds! It's just that some people (you) are more honest about it than others, so kudos!

If you don't want to shave, you don't have to provided you don't mind some raised eyebrows. Many women remove unwanted hair on their legs, bikini line and top lip as well as a line of it which can run from the navel to the crotch which is personal choice more influenced by society than anything else. Some people don't remove it more due to feminist context, or because it irritates their skin. Realize however, if you don't remove the hair - especially in your armpits - it can make it more difficult to keep the area clean and prevent B.O. from developing.

If you don't want to shave, you can always use other hair removal methods like depilatories, waxing, sugaring or electrolysis, but you're best researching them first to work out which method is best for you.

I was fortunate enough to have a mother who encouraged me not to shave as hair under the arms, on the legs, and between the legs indicates that you are becoming an adult whether you are male or female. She was also very good at pointing out how most women shave only because of social expectations, peer pressure etc. but ultimately left the decision up to me as she respected the fact that even at YY years old my body was, and is MY body. I decided that she was right and have never removed in any way any of the hair under my arms, between my legs, anal area, ""treasure trail"" on my stomach, and upper legs. I do shave my calves in the summer if I am going to be wearing shorts or a dress which isn't very often AND be in public.

 Your parents really need to back off, that is totally disrespectful of them irregardless of you living with them or not.

Sorry to hear you are going through a rough time. From what you're saying, is you hate being depressed. Remember this, depression is not the real you, depression is just depression and nothing more.

A nutrient dense diet and avoiding toxins will generally keep cancer at bay your whole life.

Cancer begins to spread and threaten your life when cells are constantly exposed to toxins - combine this with a nutrient-deficient diet and you'll be in trouble eventually.

Most of these toxins for many people with cancer come from processed foods, which contain hundreds of chemicals  and even genetically modified ingredients. (GMO - learn how to avoid them at nongmoproject.org and nongmoshoppingguide.com)

I'd say GMO foods are one of the biggest causes of cancers and tumors anymore - especially considering that these foods have been well documented to cause tumors and organ failure in the test animals.

When everything is done, the doctor said it could come back and this forced me to look somewhere else because after i spent all that money and time they basically tell me that they didn't cure it.  I asked them what to do, they are speechless. 

I have no choice but to look into alternative medicine and i found out most of the time the body has the capability to fix cancer itself if you fuel them the right food and exercise and there are many other natural ways to cure cancer.  I am now cancer free and no longer worry about cancer coming back.  Even if it does come back, i know what to do to cure it.  Prevention and treatment of cancer is the same as cancer is a natural process that grow out of control.

While I am a stern proponent of vaccination, I thought it better to answer her question than attack her. I've been a chemotherapy nurse for 10 years.

MMR, varicella, rotovirus, and the nasal flu vaccine are all live-attenuated viruses. Once an individual is vaccinated, there is a small risk of infection to individuals with immune compromise.

Also, there is NO risk of contacting things like measles, mumps, or whooping cough from someone who DOESN'T have it. While unvaccinated children are at risk of contracting these diseases, they are not automatically carriers just because they haven't had their shots - which is what it sounds like some of you are saying.

Citrus fruits such as oranges that contain a lot of Vitamin C, Vitamin C helps increase the production of white blood cells, a key to fighting infections. Red Bell Peppers, are also a good source for Vitamin C, as well as being a rich source of beta carotene's. Broccoli is super-charged with Vitamins A, C, and E, as well as numerous antioxidants. The key to keeping its power intact is to cook it as little as possible, or better yet, not at all. Garlic helps to lower cholesterol and prevent hardening of arteries. Its immune-boosting properties seem to come from a heavy concentration of sulphur-containing compounds, such as allicin. Ginger acts like Vitamin C, and is good for preventing a cold or helping a cold. It packs some heat in the form of gingerol, a relative of capsaicin, which gives chili peppers their distinctive heat. Ginger may also help decrease chronic pain and may possess cholesterol-lowering properties. Spinach is rich in Vitamin C and is packed with numerous antioxidants and beta-carotene. Yogurt is a good source of Vitamin D, studies show someone who is low in Vitamin D is more likely to catch a cold. When selecting yogurt look for ones that have ""live and active cultures"" printed on the label. Almonds (Nuts) are a good source of Vitamin E, which also helps keep a healthy immune system, Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin, meaning it requires the presence of fat to be absorbed properly. Turmeric a bitter spice has been used for years as an anti-inflammatory in treating both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. High concentrations of curcumin, which gives turmeric its distinct color, have been shown to contain strong flu and cold fighting properties. Both green and black teas are packed with flavonoids, a type of antioxidant. Where green tea really shines is in its levels of epigallocatechin gallate, or EGCG, another powerful antioxidant. The fermentation process black tea goes through destroys a lot of the EGCG. Green tea, on the other hand, is steamed and not fermented, preserving that EGCG. If that wasn't enough, it's also a good source of the amino acid L-theanine, which aids in the production of germ-fighting compounds in your T-cells.

Besides eating you should:
Get vaccinated
Cover coughs and sneezes
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth
Wash your hands often
Limit contact with Sick People
Clean your house
Practice healthy habits: Getting plenty of sleep, eating well, drinking lots of fluids, exercising, and managing stress can go far in keeping your family well this flu season.

Teas are also low calorie beverages that are sweetened with mint and other spices. Buy tea bags. They are cheaper than sweetened bottled drinks too. Stevia is also a natural sweetener.

I know it can be frustrating. This REALLY works!! There are 3 people sent me an email saying to me that it worked for them!! This was also been chosen by 10 members to be the best answer because it worked for them too!! Proof, see my best answers!!

Gather all materials beforehand -- see ""Things You'll Need"" below. You might want to store them in a waterproof resealable bag, such as Ziploc. I'd recommend wearing either old clothes or a bathrobe over whatever you are wearing. There is a definite possibility this is going to spill. After you have found everything on you checklist, head to a large, flat, waterproof surface. This is probably your bathroom. Having this room be private is highly advised; you can't just say, ""Get out, I'm flattening a pimple,"" can you?

Things You'll Need 
- 3 or more cotton balls 
- Lukewarm tap water 
- Cup to hold the water in 
- Salt

The Method 
1. Salt the water thoroughly -- much more than you think it needs. 
2. Dip one cotton ball in the salt water. 
3. Wait for 30 - 60 seconds. 
4. Squeeze out excess water out until it is damp, but not dripping. 
5. Place the damp cotton ball over your large, oh-my-goodness-I-cannot-go-to-... zit. If you have several of these grouped together, try to place the cotton ball over them all. 
6. Glance at your watch/clock. Wait exactly three minutes. 
7. Remove the cotton ball after the time is up. The zit seems to be nearly gone, but it is only the top that has dissolved. Your acne is still there. 
8. Take the other two cotton balls and place them on either side of the despised pimple. 
9. Slowly, move them closer together until the tiny bump is flattened. Congrats! You've just conquered that giant of a pimple -- forever! 
10. Apply honey on the infected area & go to sleep!!

Tips 
*Don't forget the last 3 steps -- they are crucial. 
*Be sure to follow these steps closely. Dipping a cottonball in fresh water as opposed to salt will not work, for instants. 
* You might want to bring a book -- either waterproof or one that you do not care about being splattered in water. Those three minutes can get boring. 
* This is your best bet for monster zits that simply sneak up on you. For long-term healthy skin, cleansing and toning is also important.

Warnings 
* Please, PLEASE, do not assume this is permission to ""pop"" pimples. Doing so can cause major scarring. Please don't pop them. 
* If you stop after the top is dissolved, I must warn you: it WILL come back! Maybe not in the next five minutes, but during the course of an hour, it will come back!

You can even try applying original Head & Shoulder Shampoo to clear acne!!! I WORKS like a charm!! Read all about it here including people's comment about it! 
http://www.myhomeremedies.com/remedy.cgi?remedyid=1801&page=1

If you feel new pimples erupting, ice it! Hold an ice cube over the area for about 5-10 minutes. It REALLY works!!!

For acne scars, 
1. Lemon juice is natural bleach and helps in lightening the scars and blemishes of the skin. 
2. Rosehip seed oil is also another home remedy which reduces acne scars. It is mostly used in the cosmetic products and used for acne scarring, facial scarring, surgical scars, sun damage, premature aging, burn marks etc. This oil should be massaged twice on the acne scars daily. 
3. Application of Aloe Vera gel/juice to the fresh wounds prevents the formation of permanent scars. 
4. One of the home remedy is that ice cubes can be rubbed on the acne scars for ten to fifteen minutes. 
5. Vitamin E is considered best for the healthy glowing skin. Application of vitamin E oil or capsule to the scar will completely vanish the scar in few weeks. 
6. The most effective remedy for the scars is application of honey several times a day. It will give a natural glow to the skin and will remove all scars.

Prudent* to see a general surgeon*/local homeopath [for less costs] for physical examination, relevant investigations, accurate diagnosis and permanent cure by medication and or surgical interference

Because, in all chronic issues with complicated & confusing symptoms-involvng many organs, I prefer a General Surgeon, who shall be accurate in arriving at the right diagnosis by pin-pointing the affected organ[s]/tissues and ensures fast relief with surgical interference. 

Much before the advent of super-specialties like nuero/pediatric/cardiac/renal/gynec/brain/geriatric/orthopedic,dental, gastro-enterology, oncology, and ENT etc., all these surgeries were conducted by general surgeons. Hence, a Surgeon’s approach is most appropriate and accurate. A good surgeon suggests cheapest and accurate diagnostic investigations only to ensure permanent cure.
Whereas, for all acute problems/issues, a physician hits the symptoms/diseases with  say, 10 stones/medicines with the hope that a few stones may hit with dramatic relief. But, it does work in many cases & with ‘no side effects’.

However...

There are times in life when we might feel totally, hopeless, helpless, overwhelmed with emotional pain.  It can seem like there is no other way out of our problems, we've run out of ideas, possible solutions.  Our problems seem unfixable.  The pain feels like it will never end. We believe we've run out of options, and suicide is the only answer left.

Maybe the suicidal thoughts come to mind, you might have mixed feelings about them.  They're frightening and confusing. 

For some people, suicide may be a way of getting back at others, or showing them how much pain you're in.  But after suicide, you won't be there to see that they feel guilty, or finally understand your pain.

Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.

Feelings will pass.  Depression feels permanent, but it's transient.  Things will change.  Depression comes and it goes.  Over 90% of people who survive a potentially lethal suicide attempt, do not go on to kill themselves.  It is a temporary crisis, an attempt to stop the inner pain.    You will get through this tunnel and come out the other side.  The feelings will pass!

Depression and pain distort our thinking.  It can seem like we're wearing very dark tinted 'gloomy specs'.  Everything looks different to how it really is.  Thoughts are thoughts - not necessarily how things are, although it certainly feels like the thoughts are true.  Thoughts affect the way we feel, and thoughts and feelings affect the way we react, what we do.

Suicidal thoughts can result when we experience too much pain, without having enough resources to cope.

We therefore have two ways to get us through this horrible time:

    Reduce our pain

    Increase our coping resources

REDUCE THE PAIN

Self-soothing

    Do something that will help you feel better, right now

    Perhaps collect items into an emergency bag or box that you can turn to

    Use all five senses to find things that will soothe you

Vision 	

Focus your attention on looking at something nice, nature, a painting, watching a favourite programme or movie
Hearing 	

Listen to a favourite piece of music, sounds of nature, sing
Smell 	

Really notice smells - favourite soap, food, essential oil
Taste 	

Use sensation of taste to focus your attention.  Eat mindfully - savouring each moment
Touch 	

Wear soft comforting socks, stroke a pet, give yourself a hand massage

    A useful reminder, using the 5 senses:

5
	

   5 things I can see

4
	

   4 things I can hear

3
	

   3 things I can touch

2
	

   2 things I can smell or taste

1
	

   1 breath.  Then continue to just notice your breathing, and the sensations of breathing in your body - in your nose, throat, abdomen

Avoid drugs and alcohol

    Whilst it seems like they help for a while, they will make your problems worse.

Ask yourself:

    Are these thoughts facts or my opinion?

    What has helped me feel better in the past?

    What can I do right now that will help me feel better?

    What gives my life meaning?  What are my goals, dreams or life values?  E.g. Family, friends, pets, helping others, faith, spirituality, community life, connecting with nature.

Tell yourself:

    I've coped this far, I can get through the next .... (day, hour, 10 minutes)

    Things will look better in time.

    Depression is temporary - this will pass.

    Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.

    Depression is distorting my thinking - these thoughts are the voice of depression.  They are not facts.  I don't have to act on them.

    The vast majority of people get better from depression.  I will look back and be pleased that I chose to live.

 

INCREASE COPING RESOURCES - IMMEDIATE STEPS

Take one step at a time

    Take things a little at a time.  Set out to get through the next day, the next week or month, perhaps the next hour or even less.  Tell yourself:  ""I've got through so far, I can get through the next hour"".

Distraction

    Do something else, and focus your attention fully on what you're doing, e.g.

    Gardening

    Household chores

    Physical exercise - walk, run, cycle, dance

    Tapping (Emotional Freedom Technique)

    Reading - magazine, self help book

    Television

    Seek out a supportive discussion forum on the internet

    Learn something new on the internet

    Imagery

    Help someone else

    Go to the park, the beach - pay attention to nature

    Visit someone

    Music

    Stroke a pet

    DIY

    Feed the birds

    Sudoku or crossword

    Do something creative:  painting, writing, knitting, play a musical instrument, make a collage, bake a cake, cook a meal, arrange some flowers, make a website or blog

Talk to someone - now!

    A friend or family member

    A telephone helpline  (E.g. Samaritans 08457 90 90 90)

    A health professional

    Go somewhere you'll feel safe - be with other people

    Go to the local Accident & Emergency department

    Call the local emergency number (E.g. 999, 112, 911)

 

INCREASE COPING RESOURCES - LONGER TERM STEPS

Take action!

    We can only change our situations by changing something about the way we think, or what we do


Plan activity and routine

    Increase your activity

    Get into a daily routine and stick with it - get up at the same time each day, go to bed at the same time, plan an activity each morning, afternoon and evening

    Schedule in activities which help you:  Work, rest and play

    Do things you enjoy, or used to enjoy, or you think you might enjoy:  Nourishing vs Depleting Activities

    Set realistic goals

Look after yourself

    Eat healthily, balance sleep, treat physical or mental health problems, avoid drugs and alcohol, get regular exercise

Systematically work through a problem

    Use the Problem Solving Worksheet

    Get help from an appropriate person or agency  (E.g. Citizens Advice Bureau)

Maintain or improve relationships

    Connect and be with others

    Call, text, email - friends or family

    Create new contacts - join a local support group or an online discussion forum

Lower your expectations

    Sometimes life can feel like we're struggling to drive or cycle up a long and steep hill, in top gear.  The motor just can't get us there.  It works really hard, but it's impossible to get up that steep hill in top gear.  We need to change down a gear or two.  Changing down gives the motor more torque, and is much better able to drive those wheels up that hill, albeit a bit slower.

Fast Facts Of Paracetamol Overdose:

The lethal action takes 2-3 days to start and during these 2 to 3 days you will have slight vomiting and suffer from nausea and a slight pain on the right side of the tummy! Unlike other drugs, you don't go into coma after an overdose of paracetamol. This is very annoying because next morning you will wake up normally and wonder what happened to you!
After 2-3 days, liver starts getting damaged (Hepatic damage) and so does your kidneys (Renal damage).
Slight signs of jaundice appears (bilirubin starts increasing. The normal bilirubin level is 1 and when it increases beyond 1, it means jaundice is making a hole in you!) and you will face terrible pain in stomach.

Believe me! This is when you will be taken to hospital and saved! Just in case you manage to stay out of hospital and don't visit a doctor, there are fairly good chances that intra-abdominal bleeding will start and you may face aspiration pneumonia,And it could take up to a week to die.(If left untreated)

(If you really are contemplating suicide please just think about what your doing but theres nothing i can do to stop you but if your are at least do it right but in most cases of overdoses you are just taken to the hospital and are saved but you are left with 2 really ruined livers and in some case life destroying medical problems.BUt i would check out the link i posed in ""Source"".",0,0,False,http://wantdeath.blogspot.co.uk/2011/07/method-10-of-suicide-paracetamol.html

but let's just point out what would happen if you overdosed. first of all, i don't think you realise how many people would be affected. in drama class we are doing a script that i thought was stupid first but now i totally get it - a guy kills himself because he believes no one cares. obviously, his family hate themselves and his friends wish theyd been better to him. but other people get affected also, those strangers he sees in the halls suddenly wish they'd said something and teachers wish they hadnt been so harsh and everyone suddenly wishes they'd prevented it, because they all cared about him. then word gets around to his family friends and everyone who knew him felt a huge hole because they just knew it was preventable. and it is, if you ever want to talk to someone im always here, you can email me any time. you can talk to trained professionals, doctors, your parents, your friends, your teachers, just anyone you feel somfortable with. depression and suicidal thoughts can be prevented, it takes time but it can.

so then, what happens if you overdose and end up in hospital? a kid in the year above me actually did this, and he had to change schools. the head teacher didnt want any copycats, and most schools actually tend to remove the child from their school. its sad but its true. then there are the actual health issues, you could be left with permanent damage with your stomach, liver, digestive system and more (please correct me if i'm wrong, i was told this by a teacher), and you could live the rest of your life with serious health conditions, which would obviously suck ass.

i know its difficult but its best to get rid of these thoughts, its definitely easier said than done, but it is possible. i was so depressed for such a long time and then i suddenly saw all the good things in a cruel world, and after a year or 2 and some help from my friends, i feel so much better about myself. i know you said you were being abused and bullied, so maybe you might not want to tell family and friends but there is ALWAYS someone. you can contact childline, ive used it before and its actually very helpful. you can talk to teachers like i said, its embarrassing at first but they will sort it out, trust me. things like depression and suicide shouldnt be romanticized and inspirational, you are your own hero and you need to find help.

so to answer your question, if you overdose and end up in hospital you could possibly suffer from permanent health damage, get asked to leave your school and maybe even end up even more upset than you are now. the best option is to find help, i promise :) and sorry for the very long answer",0,0,True,

If you can't realise this on your own, there are so many organisations that you can call, because there are so many more people going through the same thing you are.

I use them just as I am starting my period and when I am finishing (that's when my flow is light, but when my flow is really heavy I wear a pad) 

to put a tampon in first you gotta sit on the toilet with your legs apart, then find you vagina (cause you don't wanna stick a tampon up the wrong hole LOL) then depending on the type of tampon put the tip of the tampon right over your vagina (make sure it is angled up a little bit, so it slides right in) then just push the tampon in! 

and don't worry about it getting lost, because the string that is attached is pretty long! and if you are using an applicator to help put it in, you can only push the tampon in so far, so your good (y). and even if the string breaks (which I have never heard of happening) you can just reach in a grad it. 

and it shouldn't hurt when your putting it in ... and if it does your putting it in wrong (which I have done once!! honestly it wasn't THAT painful, it was more a feeling of discomfort than anything) so just pull it out and try again at a different angle (with a new tampon) 

And since you are a dancer a tampon will definitely make you feel less constricted. I think its worth a try

Menstrual cups are internal like tampons but FAR safer and more hygienic so no risks of TSS, vaginal infections, increased cramps, or dioxin - thus they can be worn for up to 12 hours, with any flow, before your period, overnight, and no need to alternate with pads so a lot more convenient than tampons. Menstrual cups are more comfortable, can reduce flow and cramps, also don't leak like tampons or pads.

I seriously recommend you consider cups instead of tampons, they're far better in general but also when active they're better than tampons as you can't wear tampons when your flow is light, tampons can increase cramps, and tampons leak. Any cup user will tell you, tampons suck by comparison. 

If you do still want to use tampons...

Avoid rayon tampons like Tampax, Playtex, or Kotex - these are made from rayon which is rougher than cotton so causes more damage to vaginal tissues, also is more favourable to bacteria and contains chemicals - these increase risk of TSS, vaginal infections, increased cramps, contain dioxin, and more likely to cause irritation too. Opt for cotton tampons like Cottons, Natracare, or Emerita, you may also be more comfortable with sponge tampons like J&P or soft tampons like Beppy as they're soft and squishy plus are moistened before use with either water or lubrication so not as drying or irritating. 

Non-applicator are best - applicators sole purpose is to limit genital contact, not to make insertion easier, and as there's nothing wrong with genital contact there's no reason to use applicators. Non-applicator are easier because they're simpler, have rounder tips, you have more control over depth so you can insert high enough first time, and you have more control over direction as you can more easily feel for resistance. 

Always start with lowest absorbency during heaviest flow; if the tampon leaks within 1-2 hours use higher, but if the tampon isn't saturated with blood after 4-6 hours use lower absorbency or switch back to pads. It helps to use lubrication the first time too, something like KY jelly or a natural oil like coconut oil or olive oil around the vaginal opening and on the tampon - do not ever use Vaseline or baby oil. 

Masturbation helps as when aroused your vagina relaxes, lubricates, opens, increase in size, and tents to allow penetration, thus it can help when inserting a little tampon - same goes for if you struggle with removal too. It also helps to explore your genitals, if you haven't already, to get used to inserting things vaginally and learn to purposefully tense/relax vaginal muscles so you can relax them during insertion.

As long as you use tampons correctly and relax (if you tense vaginal muscles tense, thus causing vaginal walls to clench) they shouldn't hurt, although they can be uncomfortable. As long as you relax they also won't get stuck either - what goes up must come down.",0,0,True,

Tampons can offer you a lot of freedom during your period.  Personally, I like being able to keep track of my flow, and that's why I usually use a pad, but here are some tips:

Start out by trying the lowest absorbency tampon you can get.  Something like ""lite"" or even ""regular"" will work.  Definitely use plastic applicators - they are much easier to insert.  When you try them, do it on the heaviest day of your period.  Follow the instructions in the box.  When you insert it, remember to point up and toward your back, not straight up.  You shouldn't be able to feel it when it's inserted properly.

You should only wear the lowest absorbency that you need to control your flow for 4-6 hours.  They way to tell if you need to change is easy - when you go to the bathroom, gently pull on the string.  If it starts to slide out easily, it's time to change.  If it stays put, you can leave it in for a bit longer, but NEVER more than eight hours.  In fact, you might want to switch to a lower absorbency so that it's ready to be changed about every six hours or so, just to be safe and prevent TSS.

Don't flush applicators or used tampons.  The box might say you can, but believe me, it's not a good idea!  Wrap them in toilet paper and put them in the trash or the receptacle in the stall.

Finally, wear a liner or a pad along with tampons for the first few times you use them until you get used to it.  I always wear a liner just in case.",0,0,False,

Clear Skin Gently: Everyone washes their face before going to bed, I would tell you to do it with gentle soap or some of herbal face wash and let it dry by its own or use soft and clean towel.

Avoid using Soap - I would also tell you to stop or avoid using soap as soap is very harsh for our skin, Use face wash instead of soap.

Care for you hairs too - Most people dont even know that hairs are also a most common reason for acne. Hair contains lot of germs which affects your skin. So if you are caring for acne then you should have to take care for your hairs too.

Above are some of remedies or precautions to take care for your skin

Also there are some medicines are active in the market which works best for acne e.g Tretinoin cream, Retin A cream.

You've got several choices- if you think you can wait for it to work, take a stool softener or a laxative (stool softener is probably better, but laxatives work quicker, just don't make a habit of using them); or you can drink a big glass of water or fruit juice (like grape juice or prune juice, but make sure it's real juice, not juice drink or punch). These will probably help within a couple of hours.

You can also try doing some light exercises; something as simple as walking a few laps around your house may help. The movement seems to help make the muscles down there work better...don't know why, it just works. This also may not work immediately, it may take a while after you walk for it it to work.

Another option, if you really feel you need relief right away, is to give yourself an enema or have someone (like your mom) do it for you. I mention this because of how bad you say you feel- an enema will usually give you relief within a few minutes, but it needs to be done carefully...whoever does it should follow the directions on the package very carefully.

Finally, if nothing helps within a few hours and you are still in pain, go to the hospital. It's possible you may have a more serious problem, like an impaction. In this case, there's something in the intestines that's actually blocking them, keeping you from being able to go. This is pretty rare, but it can happen. Even if that's not the problem, they can help you more than you might be able to do at home.

An easy way to do this is to go on a diet of ready-made meals like Smart Ones or some other commerical variety.

Up your workout to seven days a week.  Try to do 40 minutes of cardio and 20 minutes of strength training.  (Do alternating strength training so that you're not working the same muscles on back-to-back days, but rather on alternating days.)  Work out hard enough to get breathing hard and sweaty, but not to the point where you're exhausted and dehydrated.  Standard advice before beginning any workout is consult with a doctor first to make sure you're healthy enough to be doing this.

Weigh yourself every morning after using the bathroom.  Record your daily weight.  This is for motivation.

Every two weeks or so, for ONE MEAL ONLY eat whatever you want.  Don't weigh yourself for the next two days after doing this.

Drink a LOT of water.

If you stick to this program faithfully, you could lose 5 pounds a week.  This is an unhealthy rate of weight loss to sustain, and if you continue it, you will notice repercussions.  Like for instance, you may start to shed a lot of hair.  After you've lost your 10 pounds, increase your diet to a more healthy 1,400 to 1,600 calories per day and set a weight loss goal of closer to 2 pounds a week, 3 at the most.

Try exercising daily. You could do Insanity 3 times a week and something different on the other 4 days if you like. Cardio is best for weight loss! So running, swimming, cycling etc. 

Make sure that the foods you eat are the right foods also. Lots of vegetables (especially green ones) some fruit, healthy fats, lean protein and wholegrains. Swap white bread/flour/pasta for wholemeal and white rice for brown. Also swap whole milk for skim/trim/soy. Limit fried, deep fried, creamy, fatty and sugary foods. Drink a lot of water and green tea (green tea is believed to help speed up your metabolism).

calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,
start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the

disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target

I've been in this situation so many times where I just felt lost and had no idea where I was going in life. It made me depressed and my quality of life was just at an all time low. I'm 36 years old and have been struggling with these issues for over a decade. I just don't know what is wrong but I've been able to adapt and get everything back from when I was younger, I'm talking YY-YY when I felt I was in my prime with my sex life. I started having problems after a break up with a girlfriend that I thought was the one but she basically tore my heart out. I was about 24 years old and when I started dating other women, my sex life was doomed. I've had it all from erection problems to all kinds of performance problems. Some were in my head. Anyways, since then I've tried all kinds of things. You know about viagra I'm sure...Who doesn't know about that stuff haha.

At that point in my life, I tried it but couldn't get it all the time due to the doctors and my age. I knew a buddy who would steal the stuff from his dad for me. I just noticed that it's terrible stuff. I try to avoid pharmeceuticals as it is. I noticed I would get terrible migraines and an occasional blurred vision which truly was scary...Sure the erection was great but the side effects blew... In the meantime years passed and I found the love of my life again. The sex was good, the erections were great. No problems at all. No more viagra was needed for quite some time...Then all of a sudden, well you can geuss. Sex life down the toilet again.

I was in my 30's by this time and just was stuck again. I suffer from depression so all this time I'm thinking I'm going through another low libido spell cause of it. Now I go to the doctors cause I feel ok talking about my problem. I've been on the cialis crap and some other one I can't remember nor do I want to look it up lol. Anyways it's all the same crappy side effects that just make everything terrible.

I did some research and after a while everything started to make sense. I hated pharmaceuticals and a friend told me about the herbal way to get an erection and all these good articles about it. He said chinese men have been using these herbs for centuries to cure there problems in the sack. I figured what the hell...might as well give it a shot if it's not going to give me any side effects. I tried a couple of these out. To my amazement, both of them did what I needed so I kinda just have fun with each one. I'll explain why. I just needed something to get up. This one I found called vigrx plus was the one for this. It's all herbal and after a couple days of taking..you take it daily, I noticed right away my junk just wanted to stand straight up, sex drive was something that was crazy..you really can't handle yourself ..lol jk but you are like a teenager again... Check this stuff out at hughs-reviews.com because I saved money on it at the time there along with this other supplement I got there too...Check for coupons and updates. This one I just wanted to see if it worked cause it was suppose to increase your semen quality and amount. So right there I'm thinking damnn that must give you one hell of an orgasm. This was semenax, and I fiddle with it every once in a while when I want to load my wife up. She's always impressed with the amount and she even says it tastes better!! yippy if you know what I mean. Overall, I'm so glad I took the herbal route of keeping my sex life up to par.

Libido can be lowered due to illness, or stress, or some degree of depression.

Therefore you should not seek to increase libido but simply seek to return it to normal, by treating the condition causing loss or lessening of it.

Please therefore please consider editing your answer to provide some information about your health circumstances.

I hope this helps.

Robert.",1,0,False,

Get one of those small wrench pieces that have the hole in them. That is your bowl, the thing you put your weed into. Get a water bottle. Cut a hole in the middle of the cap and put the wrench piece in so it fits securely. Get a hollow pen part (the body of a pen with everything taken out) and stick it through the bottle about 1.5 inches from the bottom. Now load the weed into the wrench piece and place the wrench piece on the water bottle and maybe turn it a little so it stays securely on. Put your lips over the pen and suck in while lighting the weed. It's kind of an awkward position but when you start seeing smoke stop lighting and keep sucking in until the bottle fills with smoke. Take the cap off (be careful, the metal wrench piece will be hot), and inhale all the smoke in the bottle from the top. Repeat until the weed ashes and you don't get anymore smoke. You can stash that bottle in a bush near your house or smoking spot to use at later times.",0,0,False,

    FORGET  THE   ALCOHOL.

    I know,  you know  a  lot of  people  who  drink.

    You're  YY,  according  to   you.   You  get  caught 

    with that,  there  will  be,  and  should  be,  consequences.

    MEDICALLY,  it's   worse  than  bad.  Treating  anxiety  with

    alcohol,  seems  logical,  but,  you  have  to,  at  some  point,

    correct  the  problem.  And,  you  also  have  to  be   ready
   
    to   accept   that   you  have  to  be  functional.   So,  alcohol,

    is  not,  at  the  end  of  the  day,  a  medication.

    It's  a   chemical,   that   is  turned  into  another  chemical,

    that  alters  the  consciousness.   

    Social  anxiety,  is  something  that  affects   many  people.

    But,  it  is   treatable.   Totally.

    Get  some  qualified   help  with  your   fears  and   anxieties.

    Life  is  not  something  to  be  feared, my  friend,  it' s  to

    be   enjoyed.

It can have some pretty serious side effects (behaviorally, psychologically, medically). I would suggest talking to someone. You can be put on safe anti-anxiety medications which can help with the symptoms, and/or you can enter talk therapy where you can learn techniques about ways to better manage the symptoms. 

I'm sure you;ve tried a lot, so I'm not going to go into ways you can try to relax (like yoga and mindfulness and whatnot). But this IS treatable. Don't give up, and try to stay healthy. Drinking may put a band-aid on it for a short while, but it wont fix it and it can cause greater problems in the long run.

One thing I do suggest is not doing too much too soon. Gradually work your way into the world again if you suffer from severe social anxiety. Don't try to jump in the deep end. Just walk around out side by yourself and observe people.. then go to the park and sit on a bench. imagine yourself interacting with people. then try to do so....so on and so forth. Once you can feel relaxed doing one thing, move onto something a little more challenging. it will eventually and gradually get better. Don't try to do it all in one day. Be patient with yourself. It didn't start occuring overnight and it won't go away overnight either. 

Visualization helps A LOT. If you can't even think about something without getting anxious, then there is no way you will actually be able to do it without suffering. But once you have thought about it enough and thought about ways to relax and cope, you will feel better, more in control, and better able to handle the situation when the time comes.",1,0,True,

Humans take birth on earth plane to settle his/her give-and-take account with others and to exhaust his/her destiny or undergo his/her merits and demerits.

If you only have interest in worldly life you will trap in this great illusion for many births to come.
You have to progress in both worldly and spiritually, then only you can lead a happy and peaceful life.

Remedy for anxiety/depression lies in spirituality not in medical.

You are under influence of negative energies, the thoughts and the symptoms which you have mentioned all are thoughts of negative entities.

You can get out of your anxiety/depression if you include spirituality into your life.

Include spirituality into your life and lead life as per spirituality to be a happy and content human now.

To lead a happy life, just chant the name of the god according to the religion of birth, go here ssrf.org

Also don't forget to chant ""SHREE GURU DEVA DATTA"". This is a protective chant which will protect you, believe me.

Start spiritual practice immediately ASAP for leading better life in future.

Take care to chant, chanting will take care of you.

This is about experiencing pain, which can go along with the treatments I've just referre to.

'The two things to practice are acceptance and mindfulness.  

When I say ""acceptance,"" I don't mean pretending that the pain is good. I mean being realistic - above all, not hoping that it will go away overnight or that we'll live happily ever after, like in a fairy tale. It also means not getting carried away about it - me not saying that a bad day was the worst day of my life, as if I had a day-evaluating machine and data collected from my whole life.  If you have a bad day, just say ""I had a bad day"" Period.

Mindfulness takes a bit of explaining but it's not hard to understand.  It means awareness - awareness of the here and now and awareness of what's happening in our bodies and minds.

Suppose you were wearing sunglasses day and night for two weeks, and the glasses were so dark that you could hardly see where you were.  One day, you took the glasses off.  Imagine how things would look - all that light, color and details - the grain of wood in a chair or sunlight reflected off points on a glass bottle.  

The room would seem real, more real than ever before.  It's a intense feeling of the here and now. When we're lost in our thoughts, it's like wearing sunglasses.  We don't really see what's around us.

Most of our troubles are in the past or the future.  If we're right there in the present moment, we feel better.  If we quiet our thoughts, we know the present moment.  Also, we notice as thoughts come and go, including the negative thoughts that hurt - memories and fears of the future that are useless and often false.

Look at your hands and slowly move them as if washing your hands.  Notice the feelings in your fingertips as your gently rub your fingers together.  Look at the palms of your hands.  Notice all the lines going across the palms.  Take two slow, deep breaths. Say, ""Here and now.""  You're in the present moment, where past and future don't bother you.  Look around and notice all the light and color in the room.  When thoughts come to you, notice them but don't get lost in them.  If a memory comes to you, don't go back to the past and relive the memory.  Let the thoughts come and go.  Notice the negative thoughts and let them go.  Don't fight with any thoughts - just let them go.

As the prognosis for CHF back then ( treatment has improved ) was that 50% of patients would die in two years and 70% would die in five years, my response to Diabetes was ""That's not too bad, I have worse problems."".   My choice was either heart transplant or risk other organs to give the heart a chance to recover, diabetes was just a byproduct of it all and there was probably a genetic vulnerability anyways so I was probably going to face diabetes anyways.

I'd imagine type 1 must be very difficult on the young because you are growing up with it but it is something that can be managed.   It's not always easy to deal with and as with any chronic illness, it is always with you and you get tired of it.   I often don't want to take my insulin or heart meds either but really, as long as you stay with it, you can have a normal life.

I have to say, they didn't teach me anything about diabetes at the hospital, they just did the syringe in the orange bit.   I went years before finding out I could use NPH instead of Lantus, NPH is covered by more plans and is dirt cheap by comparison to Lantus.   I also went years before learning it was about the energy I need not just the carbs I eat.   Yeah, diabetes sucks but what sucks more is they don't tell you what you should know about it.",1,1,True,

Some studies have shown that this process is inhibited by most illicit drugs, such as cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine. However, says Xia Zhang of the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, marijuana's effect on neurogenesis has not been clear.He and his colleagues started investigating this mystery by searching cell surfaces in live, cultured slices of rat hippocampus for receptors that respond to marijuana and a few other similar drugs, called cannabinoids. They reasoned that if marijuana affected neurogenesis in the hippocampus, then cells in that area must have a way to recognize the drug. Sure enough, 95 percent of hippocampus cells responsible for neurogenesis showed evidence of cannabinoid 1 ( CB1 ) receptors, one of two receptors that respond to cannabinoid drugs. http://www.mapinc.org/drugnews/v05/n1624/a06.htmlThe current study focused on a particular formulation of synthetic cannabinoid known as HU210 -- a compound which Zhang described as the most powerful cannabinoid in the world.The authors explored both the short-term and long-term effects of exposure to HU210 in rats.To measure the drug's short-term response, they gave adult rats a single injection of HU210. To study the same drug's effect over the longer term, the researchers gave a separate group of adult rats twice-daily injections of the cannabinoid over a two-week period.Autopsies revealed that by the end of the 10-day HU210 treatment regimen, new neurons had been generated and integrated into the circuitry of the hippocampus region of the rat's brains. This process, known as neurogenesis, was still in evidence a full month after treatment had been initiated.Neurogenesis was not triggered in response to brain cells being killed through cannabinoid exposure, the researchers add. In fact, HU210 injections did not appear to prompt any loss of neurons in the hippocampus. http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=54893Mind you, the study is using a super-concentrated drug form and the verdict is still out on smoking it, but they do suggest THC is the only known drug that actually can reverse the loss of brain cells...",0,0,False,

The THC chemical in marijuana travels to your brain when you eat or smoke the plant, and there it connects with special brain cells called Cannabinoid receptors. The THC then lightly coats these cells and in effect sort of tickles them, thereby getting you high.

This is called a state of ketosis (meaning our body is using protein as energy). This is not a good state to be in for long because it will rob the body of muscle tissue in an effort to create energy. On the other hand, if too many carbohydrates are consumed, they convert into stored fat. The idea is to consume just enough carbohydrates to make it through our workouts with sufficient energy. I have broken down carbohydrates into these three categories: • Simple carbs: These are sugars, or quick energy. They are absorbed very quickly into the body. Ex. Anything with sugar, also fruit • Complex carbs: This is where you get long-term energy for the day. These are long chained carbohydrates that brake down slower, giving us energy over a prolonged period of time. Ex. Oatmeal, potatoes, pasta, rice, breads • Fibrous carbs: These are things like vegetables. I think of them as roughage in order to stay regular. Make sure you include them in you later meals when you can't eat complex carbs. They are also a good source of vitamins. Ex. Leafy vegetables like lettuce.Protein Proteins are the building blocks of our muscles. Without a sufficient amount of protein in our diet, our muscles will not have the raw materials that they need to build up, or even hang on to what is already there. Net protein utilization: Not all protein is created equal. Different foods are absorbed more than others. For example, egg white protein is absorbed at 88%. That means we get about 9 eggs to our muscles. On the other hand, chicken breast are absorbed at 68%, meaning we get about 7 breasts to our muscles. It is imported to eat a wide verity of protein foods though; no one protein source has all the amino acids we need. • Whey protein (100%): the best source of whey protein is from protein supplements. It is also absorbed very fast by the body, so it is best to take this when your body needs amino acids quickly: like right after a workout or when you first get up in the morning. • Egg whites (88%) • Fish (78%) • Chicken breast (78%) • Soy protein: My one bit of advice would be to try and stay away from soy protein. It is not absorbed very well by the body. Fats We normally think of fats as being bad. The fact is certain fats are essential to building muscle and carrying out various functions of the body. There are 2 fat types we need to be concerned about: • Saturated fats: these are the bad fats. Avoid these fats as much as possible. You will find these types of fats mostly in meats • Unsaturated fats: these are the good fats. They are a good energy source and help us build muscle. You can find from plant oils. Peanuts are also a good source. Water Do not under estimate the importance of water! If you are looking to get lean, water will be your best friend. Drink as much as you can and as often as you can. Also, it is very important to drink lots of water when you're eating large amounts of protein to clean urea from the system. Vitamins & minerals As resistance training athletes, we have a greater need for vitamins & minerals. When we workout and bring blood to our muscles it is important that our blood is full of those essential vitamins & minerals if we want to grow. Supplements Supplements are just that, meaning they are used to supplement your diet, not replace it. Don't ever think of it that way. Hierarchy of supplements:I developed this hierarchy of supplements based on what I thought were the most important and also by price. • 1. Proper diet: Without proper diet you are just wasting money on supplements. Start here! Do not think that supplements are going to do it for you alone. • 2. Multi-vitamin & mineral: It is very important to have all your vitamins & minerals when resistance training. Most of us are lacking in some areas, make it a priority to make this your first supplement. • 3. Protein powder: It is usually very hard to get all the protein you need from real foods. Powders make it much easier. Also, these powders are absorbed fast by the body making them ideal after workouts or before and after sleep. • 4. Creatine: This is great for harder workouts. It also makes you muscles hang on to water, giving them a better environment to grow. • 5. L-glutamine: This is an important amino acid in muscle recovery • 6. Branch chained amino acid: These are great before and after workouts along with L-glutamine because it gives your muscles all the amino acids it needs to repair and grow. • 7. ZMA: This helps you release more growth hormone while you sleep, increasing your size and strength. • 8. Thermogenic: These really help in the fat loss process. They also help you hang on to more muscle while dieting due to the fact you can eat more. • 9. Meal replacement: Although very expensive, meal replacements make it much more convenient to get some of your meals in. Also, you can get in more meals than if you were to eat only real foods.",0,0,True,

I noted that one answerer gave advice re: veggies. Very good advice at that. Any diet with brussel sprouts and Carrotsmost certainly, will assist you in your dietary quest for gass-less-ness, we'll call it. Another fact, is that, you should stay away from any fiber, or at least, cut way down on your consumption of the same.

I have been told that it is not only effective for gas, but also, makes you feelphysically cleansed and fabulous. Now, as for the non-medicine treatment for gas: Use a drop of peppermint, cinnamon or ginger extract mixed in a cup of water. This recipe relaxes the muscles of the esophagas, allowing gas to escape, if you will pardon my frankness, at either end.

Farting is in part due to rotting of incompletely digested foods in your digestive passageway. Farting in itself is actually helpful, as it represents unwanted gas leaving your body. In fact, if you have an urge to fart, be sure to do so. The point is, if you are farting a lot, then you probably have a lot of toxin formation occurring inside your gut from rotting of incompletely digested food, and some of these toxins are entering your blood stream and contributing to the development of long term disease. Please note that I am referring to farts that make your family and friends yelp. Farts that do not produce objectionable odor are usually pockets of air that you have swallowed.Enough about farting. What can you do to improve your digestion and prevent toxin formation from rotting of undigested food in your gut?1. Chew your food until liquid. You don’t have teeth anywhere else in your digestive passageway. By chewing your food until liquid, you allow your digestive organs to do their jobs efficiently without the burden of having to break down larger chunks of food. If you don’t remember anything else from this newsletter, please remember this one point. It can make a huge difference in your level of health.2. Consistently eat whole, unprocessed foods. An apple is better than apple juice. A bowl of oatmeal is better than a power bar. An organic egg is better than any egg substitute. And organic butter is much better than margarine. The closer your foods look like they can be found in a garden, in the wild, or on an organic farm, the greater chance your body has of efficiently digesting them.3. Avoid foods that experience tells you no matter how well you chew, your body just says no. Based on your genetics and health status, there are foods that your body will digest beautifully, and there are foods that your body simply cannot break down. It’s your job to observe how you feel after each meal to identify these foods. It is important to note that as your health changes over time, your tolerance for different foods may also change, so you don’t need to write off a particular food forever if it isn’t working for you right now.4. Don’t eat fruit for dessert. Fruits are extremely low in protein compared to all other foods, including vegetables. And all foods that have significant protein must spend about an hour to an hour and a half in your stomach, where the protein is broken down by acid produced by your stomach. If fruit gets caught up in your stomach because there are other foods churning there already, it is possible that some of the fruit will rot, resulting in gas and toxin formation. Try to eat fruit on an empty stomach, or about two hours after a big meal.5. Take it easy for at least 30 minutes after a big meal. In order for your digestive organs to effectively break down food, they need to receive a large portion of your total blood volume after a big meal. If most of your blood is flowing to your muscles because you are running around, you’re not going to have enough available for your digestive organs to do good work.Use the amount that you fart as a marker for your digestive strength and the health of your gut. By following the steps outlined above, you should see a dramatic reduction in gas production.It is important to note that if you are currently eating a lot of processed foods and want to make the jump to eating mainly whole, unprocessed foods, doing so may cause a lot of farting in the beginning. This is due to your intestines and the trillions of bacteria that live in them getting used to a new selection of foods. For many people, it takes about a month to adapt to a whole food diet.",0,1,False,

Weight loss can be really easy to learn but the problem is nobody wants to put the required effort that is needed to actually do it, instead people continually look for (easy) ways to do it. If there was an easy way to lose weight I don?t think 35% of Americans would be obese. There was a time when I also wanted to lose weight and was tired of starting diets only to lose motivation and give up just a few weeks later after seeing no results. However, let me tell you it is literally one of the easiest things you will ever learn once you find a good and reputable place to learn it from and I say that only because the world is filled with magic diet pills, liquid flush diets and a thousand other quick fixes that promise xx pounds of weight loss in the first week and even though it is impossible they know you?re going to do it because your desperate. I have probably tried every diet pill, liquid flush diet, and ab rocket machine known to man and have had no success with any of them nor do I know anyone that has ever had any success with them. I have also tried starving myself which works very well for the first few weeks? right before your metabolism comes to a complete stop and eating just the tiny bit makes you gain weight and you end up weighing more than you did before you started starving yourself.

His weight loss program is one of the best I have ever had the enjoyment of doing and it is without doubt the best success I have ever had with any weight loss program. I also couldn?t be happier with my body right now and I have never felt this wonderful in my whole life. In the end you just got to remember to stick with it and stay confident in yourself and in no time you can achieve the results you have always wanted. It?s not hard to lose weight but most people have a hard time staying motivated and 9 times out of 10 it was because they weren?t really committed from the beginning.

However, if you're truly not hungry, don't force yourself to eat. The idea of eating 3 meals a day is stupid and isn't part of our innate biology as human beings. In reality, we should graze throughout the day as we become hungry. Keep some low calorie, high protein snacks on you and eat as you feel hungry or symptomatic (as in you feel foggy, grumpy, weak, or whatever you feel when you need to eat). Each person's actual necessary calorie intake is different. Each person changes throughout their life and with varying amounts of physical activity, stress, and illness. The best way to be thinner and healthy is to listen to your body. If you're hungry - eat! If you're not, don't. Also, avoid empty calories and artificial foods.

The average age is 12, but every girl's body has its own schedule. Although there's no one right age for a girl to get her period, there are some clues that menstruation will start soon. Typically, a girl gets her period about 2 years after her breasts start to develop. Another sign is vaginal discharge fluid (sort of like mucus) that a girl might see or feel on her underwear. This discharge usually begins about 6 months to a year before a girl gets her first period. You will probably feel some moderate symptoms when you first get your period. You may notice that you feel bloated or uncomfortable. This is caused by water that your body retains during menstruation. Other signs that you might start your period include a slight headache, leg ache or backache for a few hours. The most common symptom of getting your period is cramping. You may feel abdominal cramping, similar to a stomach ache for the first few days of your period. Talk to your Mum to get you some over-the-counter pain medication, such as Advil or Tylenol, for the pain if you experience cramping during your first period. You may notice some emotional changes too before your period. You may feel tense, angry, or sad because of the hormones your body is releasing. Don’t get too discouraged. These symptoms won’t last long.Remember that everyone is different so this is only a guideline.

Addictive behaviors tend to come in clusters, so if you have an eating disorder, a problem with drugs or alcohol, or gambling, you may be a candidate for shopping addiction. Many communities have credit counseling centers that will also help with shopoholism. *Make a shopping list and only buy what is on the list. *Destroy all credit cards except one to be used for emergency only.*Avoid discount warehouses. Allocate only a certain amount of cash to be spent if you do visit one*Window shop"" only after stores have closed. If you do ""look"" during the day, leave your wallet at home. *Avoid phoning in catalog orders and don't watch TV shopping channels*If you're traveling to visit friends or reltives, have your gifts wrapped and call the project finished; people tend to make more extraneous purchases when they shop outside their own communities. *Take a walk or exercise when the urge to shop comes on. *If you feel out of control, you probably are. Seek counseling or a support group such as Debtors Anonymous. *Every compulsive spender is different. Do you spend only occasionally but in big splurges? Or are you on a constant spend-a-thon, moving from one credit card to the next? Do you go nuts for a particular commodity -- electronics, food, jewelry?

Is it a creative outlet or a form of self-expression? Does being at the mall ease loneliness? ""If so, see if you can find other ways to meet those needs.""*Compulsive spenders face more than financial losses, Ask yourself how much time you spend browsing on the Internet or stalking some great deal. How else could you spend your time in ways that would truly improve your quality of life?*Line up this product you want with some bad buys you have made before, seem similar? thats a bad sign!Try this advice it really helps.... also don't spend on impulse, if you see something you really want come back to the store in 3 weeks, do you still want it?

Betel leaf helps but it is very strong.If it is acute pl search a painful point (with round tipped pen/jimmy) 3-6 mm behind your thumb nail and press it, H/A will disappear within 30 seconds.For forehead/eye pain the points are in front of nails on the finger tips or 3-7 mm below.It may disappear naturally too.Source(s):SHREE SWASTHYAYOG TREATMENT, TRAINING & RESEARCH INSTITUTER.H. 19, Jhulelal Society, Sector 2/E, Airoli, Navi Mumbai, INDIA.",0,0,False,

You can't go from eating garbage everyday to eating healthy overnight. The changes required to do something like that are huge and should be spread out over a period of time. If you make the changes too quickly, your body won't have time to adjust and you'll probably quit before seeing any results.At first, you shouldn't worry about your calorie count. When you start replacing unhealthy junk with healthy alternatives your calorie count will naturally be reduced because healthy choices are generally lower in calories than unhealthy ones. Start by reducing the amount of junk you eat (chips, cookies, pastries, doughnuts, soda, sugary drinks). Replace unhealthy snacks with nuts, fruits, salads and yogurt.You can then start getting rid of products made from refined flour such as white bread/pasta. Replace these with foods made from 100% whole wheat flour (check the nutrition label). The difference in the two flours is that whole wheat contains more fiber (and vitamins & minerals) which slows down the digestion process. This will keep you full for a longer period of time which will help you eat less throughout the day. Other foods that are high in fiber are fruits, vegetables, oats, beans and legumes.Eventually, you will need to start monitoring your calorie intake. Losing weight depends on you eating less than you burn. If you're not losing weight, the problem is that you're either eating too much, exercising too little or a combination of both.

Pay no attention to weight loss supplements and pills and all the latest fads. You need to think about many factors but most of them are related to issues we've known about for a very long time. There are many sensible things you can do that will make a tremendous difference over the long term if you need to lose weight. It can be done in a healthy way. This is what has worked for me.Keeping a food journal really does help. It will give you a much better sense of how much you are eating, and when, and why.Make a few additional small changes - walk everywhere, always use stairs instead of elevators, walk on escalators, get up and move around at least once an hour if your work or your life in general is sedentary, walk every day, use a pedometer. Walking 10,000 steps a day is a really good idea. Build up to a long brisk walk everyday, or most days. Be more active and watch less TV and spend less time on the computer. Buy one piece of exercise equipment to have at home and be strict with yourself about using it. Sometimes you can find mini-steppers or exercise bikes at second hand stores and thrift stores for just a few dollars.Start a weight lifting routine. Join a gym. Possibly you can find one that has someone who specializes in weight lifting programs for beginners. Weight lifting will increase your metabolism as well as improve posture and appearance overall. Even if you can't get to the gym you can work out at home using things around the house. Invest in a good weight training book. The Dummies series actually has a good one. In terms of diet, cut out or reduce things like junk food, pop, fat, fast food. Eat more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean meat, fish. Particularly if you choose a vegetarian lifestyle include natural peanut butter, hummus, dried fruit and nuts. Pay close attention to getting the nutrients your body needs to be healthy. Make your portion sizes smaller. Use a smaller plate - in our society we have become accustomed to thinking that we need a large plate of food at every meal, and we don't. About quarter of your plate of food should be protein and at least half of it should be veggies. Learn to count calories. At your current weight and activity level, you may possibly need about 2000 calories or more to maintain your current weight. So you will lose weight at a reasonable and healthy rate if you cut back to about 1600 or 1700 calories a day. Eat small amounts frequently, rather than three large meals. Never skip breakfast. Include some protein in your breakfast. It will help get you through the day.Drink plenty of water, at least 8 big glasses of water a day, and more if it is very hot, if you sweat a lot, or if you are exercising intensely, and eliminate fruit juices. Fruit juices have too many calories, so get your vitamins from fresh fruit, not the juice. You will begin to see changes in your body. Vary your routines. Don't eat the same number of calories every day (vary your calories from 1400 a day to 1900 or 2000 some days), eat a variety of foods, and do different kinds and amounts of exercise. You will lose weight much more efficiently if you mix things up from time to time so that your body doesn't adjust to any one routine.An area that many people overlook is getting enough sleep. You are much more likely to overeat or to binge eat if you are tired and not well rested, so get enough sleep.Check out websites about nutrition, exercise, weight training, etc. Here are a few helpful links.http://www.nutrawatch.com/http://www.caloriesperhour.com/http://www.helpguide.org/life/healthy_eating_diet.htmhttp://www.wikihow.com/Lose-Weight-the-Healthy-Wayhttp://weightloss.about.com/cs/fitness/a/aa011503a.htmhttp://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/features/no-weight-workout?page=4",0,0,True,

If you are really trying to lose weight, you have to stay dedicated and determined to do so. I lost around 50 pounds using just these simple tips I'm about to explain to you.I found three things to be the best but you have to use them together in order to get some great results. You have to understand that you are what you eat first. Dieting is something you might have to stick in there with and follow through with one. Some people can while others can't.The next thing you need to do is create a workout plan whether that be cardio or some other exercise to get the heart rate up. You have got to do at least 30 mins a day to get some results.The 3rd step that I'm going to explain, helps a lot if you are slobbish on your diet or just need some help with it all. For me, it's a natural herbal supplement called Proactol. It's a fat binder and an appetite suppressant. I'm very health consicious and having this supplement that is made from natural herbs, you really can't beat it. It's helped me so much but absorbing up to 28% of fat that you intake. Which means if you aren't following your dieting plans, you have a little more room for food being on the supplement. The appetite suppressant part works wonderfully too so you can actually stay away from the cookies and brownies.These steps really worked for me, you should try them out for yourself even if you want to lose very little or that extra mile. Also at the time of my 3 month supply purchase of Proactol, I saved a lot of money on it at http://theweightlossplace .comGood luck and I hope this helps you out for your weight loss goals.",0,0,False,

There is not much of a relationship between belly size and penis size. Your penis size will be the size you are given! There are no pills or creams, no toys or tools that will make a penis longer or larger. Any product claiming to do that should be regarded as being suspect. Likely it is a scam and the only thing that will get bigger is the wallet or bank account of the person/company offering the product. Look closely at the promotions and you will see that the product is not tested, inspected, approved or endorsed by any reputable organization. If it works why has it not been submitted to the U.S. Federal Food and Drug Administration for FDA Approval. If you are concerned that your penis is not large enough then consider that the average length is 5.5 inches and frankly that is plenty large enough. Read some of the posts from females who are afraid of the ""huge"" penises out there. Sure the ""American thing"" is ""bigger is better"" but that is not always the case. If you are concerned about the ladies pleasure - and that should be your main concern, you should develop a technique or style that makes the most out of what you were given. It is important to remember that sexual intercourse is not simply a piston going back and forth at a high speed. Actually a lot of the ""jocks"" haven't figured that out yet. If you work at developing a style you will score more and it will be more fun for both of you.And it will be fun learning the technique.And if you are still wanting to do something to make your penis bigger, each night before you climb into bed, get down on your knees, bow your head, and pray for a larger penis.
